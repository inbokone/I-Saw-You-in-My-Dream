3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,120
(Previously)
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,920
Are you alright?

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,120
Ow!

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,240
P' Yu, Where are you?

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm at the park.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,320
Hey!

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,080
Get off!

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,000
Huh?

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,720
Wanna get it?

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,920
Hey!

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,520
P' Yu.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,240
Are you okay?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,600
Hey!

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,240
P' Yu!

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,880
Hey!

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,240
Stay here.

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
Stay with me tonight.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,320
Why?

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,400
We used to sleep
together when we were kids.

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,800
The dreams you had, I'm jealous of it.

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,240
If I had dreamed about any accident,

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,920
I would have stopped it from happening.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
P' Yu!

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
P' Yu!

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,560
P' Yu!

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,160
P' Yu.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,760
Did you have a bad dream?

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
You hugged me so tightly.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Who hugged you?

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
I didn't hug.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Didn't hug what? I just saw that you...

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,960
I didn't hug you.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,920
Okay, okay, you didn't hug, you didn't hug.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't get mad.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,080
Lie down, I'll wipe you down.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,400
Why?

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,840
I'm not sick.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,480
You're not sick? You're burning up.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Then I'll go take a shower myself.

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,880
How can you take a shower by yourself?

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
If your wound gets wet and gets worse,
what will you do?

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Do you want to go to the doctor?

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Lie down, I'll wipe you down.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,760
Quickly.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,680
Come on.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,280
P' Yu.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Huh?

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,720
Are you okay lately?

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
Why, do I look sick?

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
No, not that.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,480
I mean, like...

54
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:33,480
Are you tired lately
or is there something...

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,960
No.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,400
Why?

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,320
Hmm.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,560
P' Yu.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,200
Huh?

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
I'll continue this myself.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Okay, okay.

62
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Then I'll go prepare the meal downstairs.

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,440
When you're done, come down.

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,100
"I Saw You in My Dream"
(Episode 3)

65
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh.

66
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Hey, I prepared some porridge for you.

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
You can eat it right away.

68
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,720
Are you expecting something in return?

69
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I have nothing to repay you with.

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm not expecting anything.

71
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,600
Didn't you say that if you
see someone in trouble,

72
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,760
we should rush to help them?

73
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
How could I not help when you're sick?

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,520
Thank you.

75
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,160
It's delicious, right?

76
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
It's from my favorite place.

77
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,680
Panpan likes it too.

78
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
Aren't you going to answer it?

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,360
P'Pan's calling.

80
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,800
Pan,

81
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,240
Wait a second.

82
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,760
Is there something else
you need to talk about, Yu?

83
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
Pan, are you really going to choose this?

84
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Why wouldn't I choose this?

85
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,800
You know how much this show means to me.

86
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll be thirty soon, Yu.

87
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
You know my chances in the industry
are very slim now.

88
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,960
This show might be my only chance
to finally become famous.

89
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you understand, Yu?

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Pan.

91
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:18,303
We have to break up, Pan.

92
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,800
And what do you want me to do, Yu?

93
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
It's a dating reality show.

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
If people know I already have a boyfriend,

95
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
who would believe the show?

96
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,680
I would.

97
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,880
I believe you, Pan, that...

98
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,400
You don't have to go on a show like this.

99
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
You can become famous on your own.

100
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,040
Do you really believe that, Yu?

101
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
Just believing isn't enough.

102
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
You know, you've seen it all along,

103
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,600
that I've tried so hard.

104
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
I've tried all the time,

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
but I'm still not famous.

106
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,520
And this is my dream.

107
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
Your dream, Pan?

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
All this time,

109
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,680
have I never been part of your dream?

110
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,800
I've thought it through
and decided on this.

111
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Anyway, don't forget to sign
the confidentiality agreement

112
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,920
that the show sent for you to sign.

113
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,120
I can call her back later.

114
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,040
Uh, P' Yu.

115
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Do you have any plans...

116
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,640
to go to the beach anytime soon?

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
The beach?

118
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
No, I don't.

119
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Not even a bit?

120
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, Ai, I've been so
busy lately, you know that.

121
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I'll probably be stuck
in the studio every day.

122
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,760
Why?

123
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
Do you want to go?

124
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
No, nothing.

125
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,440
That's good, you'll save money.

126
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,040
You should answer the call since
it's ringing so much.

127
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,560
Okay, I'll be right back.

128
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,080
(Ai: Come to my house.)

129
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,280
Huh? You dreamed that P' Yu was drowning?

130
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,400
Are you serious?

131
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,440
Yes, it's true.

132
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
When and where?

133
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
Try to think carefully about

134
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,080
what you saw in the dream.

135
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,800
I only saw that...

136
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
it was some beach.

137
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,240
But I asked P' Yu already,

138
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
and he has no plans to go anywhere.

139
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Where is Yu now?

140
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
At work.

141
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
He said he's in the studio.

142
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
When did you have the dream?

143
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Last night.

144
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
Everytime you dream about what happens,

145
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
how long apart are they?

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,520
About a day or two.

147
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
So, don't stress out yet.

148
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,960
It's not certain.

149
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,720
But what about you?

150
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
How's your arm after
getting cut by that robber?

151
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,080
It's...

152
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
okay now,

153
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
but it still hurts a little.

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
You,

155
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,240
always getting hurt.

156
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm leaving now.

157
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,840
Where are you going?

158
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,000
I have class, I need to go change.

159
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
You have class too, right?

160
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,640
Are you going?

161
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,400
No.

162
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Fine, I'll go then.

163
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
Call me if anything comes up.

164
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,720
See you.

165
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,680
Umm.

166
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,120
P' Yu, open the door for me, please.

167
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,240
P' Yu.

168
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,920
P' Yu.

169
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,040
P' Yu.

170
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,400
Can you open the door?

171
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,120
What?

172
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Can I sleep with you tonight?

173
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,920
Why?

174
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
Ai...

175
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Come on.

176
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Just a sec.

177
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,680
Can I sleep with the lights on?

178
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,360
P' Yu!

179
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
P' Yu!

180
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh, you're awake.

181
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Where did you go?

182
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,240
I went to shower.

183
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm going to go to work now.

184
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,560
Why?

185
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

186
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,680
Are you ok?

187
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,120
Could you give me a ride today?

188
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,280
But you normally don't
have any classes today.

189
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,520
Why would you...

190
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,840
But today I'm the only one who has class.

191
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't leave yet.

192
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,720
Wait for me, okay?

193
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Umm.

194
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Are you having class in this building?

195
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Yes, I have class in this building.

196
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,360
Alright, study hard.

197
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,840
P' Yu.

198
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,960
Huh?

199
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
Are you working all day today?

200
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, all day. Why?

201
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,000
Nothing, nothing.

202
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
Where are you working?

203
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,880
Here...

204
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Oh, then you can just text me.

205
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,840
Okay, okay.

206
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,960
See you.

207
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,160
(So where are you working again?)

208
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Alright, kids. Welcome to Photography 101.

209
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Today, we have a special guest.

210
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,280
Please welcome.

211
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
Hello, students.

212
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,120
I'm P' Yu.

213
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,640
Hello. / Hello.

214
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
P' Yu is currently a
freelance photographer.

215
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,040
Today, he will teach us
some photography techniques.

216
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,600
Let me introduce myself again.

217
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm a freelance photographer.

218
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,800
My name is Yu.

219
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
Let's get to the first exercise.

220
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,480
Everyone, take a
look at this picture first.

221
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
What technique do you
think this picture uses?

222
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Everyone, pick up your cameras.

223
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,960
Try guessing through your own lens.

224
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,440
Can anyone answer?

225
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
This is the Golden Ratio technique.

226
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,080
You can see that the
shape resembles a spiral.

227
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,880
So we can see that the focus point,

228
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,400
is at the end of the spiral.

229
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,640
How's that?

230
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,720
Alright.

231
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
Turn on your screen.

232
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,680
Let's give P' Yu a round of applause.

233
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,520
Thank you very much, P' Yu,

234
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,240
for coming to give a lecture.

235
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,840
I have a small assignment for you.

236
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,160
Next time, you need to
submit your final project.

237
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,760
The topic is a photograph
that tells your own story.

238
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,400
Please put effort into it.

239
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,040
Because these photos will determine
your grade, whether you pass or not.

240
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,440
If you don't pass, you might
have to retake the class.

241
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,560
Class dismissed for today.

242
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
Thank you.

243
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Thank you so much.

244
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Ai.

245
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,240
Ai.

246
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,400
What?

247
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm going home.

248
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,600
This class...

249
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,360
Yeah! I failed this class,

250
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,280
so I'm sitting here alone.

251
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,800
Well, I don't like taking pictures!

252
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
Come on, come! Make fun of me!

253
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,415
I haven't said anything yet.

254
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
I was just going to
ask you that after class,

255
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,800
do you want to go home with me?

256
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,040
Do you need my help for this class?

257
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I can help you pass.

258
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No, I don't want to owe any favors.

259
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,240
How about this?

260
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
I'll help you pass this class,

261
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,240
but in return, you have to help me
with my work for one day.

262
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,000
Okay?

263
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,240
I guarantee you'll pass for sure.

264
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
A hundred percent guarantee.

265
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,640
Alright.

266
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
Okay, Deal.

267
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
Are you going home now?

268
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
Let me grab my stuff first.

269
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,480
Hey, wait.

270
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,760
Ai, Ai.

271
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,320
Hey Ai.

272
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
Are you almost done?

273
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,960
P' Yu is waiting to eat.

274
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
Hmm, it might take a while.

275
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,800
Ouch.

276
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,400
Are you okay?

277
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,920
Ai, Ai, are you alright?

278
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,080
One hit and you're down.

279
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,160
Oh, it's nothing.

280
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,600
I'm fine.

281
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm really sorry.

282
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,320
Does it hurt a lot?

283
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,880
He's fine.

284
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,240
A person like him can take it.

285
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,560
(Shut up.)

286
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
By the way, what are you doing here?

287
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,200
Oh, he came to invite me to eat.

288
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
P' Yu is waiting.

289
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,480
To eat?

290
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,800
That means P' Yu is paying?

291
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm going to go home now.

292
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,040
See you.

293
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,880
See you.

294
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
Are you ok?

295
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,480
Are you ok?

296
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,320
It's ok.

297
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,760
Please excuse me.

299
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,920
So what made you decide
to take me out to eat?

300
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,920
Didn't you say you were bored at home?

301
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,320
Just trying to cheer you up.

302
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
What did you order?

303
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
I'm here, my dear friend!

304
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,720
Did that hurt?

305
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,840
Sorry, sorry.

306
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
I forgot.

307
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Why are you all late?

308
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,560
Sit down.

309
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Blame this popular guy.

310
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Takes forever to greet
everyone and get in the car.

311
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,840
Let's eat, I'm starving.

312
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,680
This is so delicious.

313
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,240
Wipe it for me.

314
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,760
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

315
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,280
Be careful of your wound.

316
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,160
Nachos, right?

317
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
Have you eaten here before?

318
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
It's my family's favorite place.

319
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
Don't move too much,
or you'll hurt your wound.

320
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
What do you want?

321
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,520
Shrimp.

322
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,720
Sure.

323
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,480
Ok.

324
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,440
Do you want anything else? Squid?

325
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,360
The biggest one.

326
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,960
Tell me if you want anything.

327
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,440
I'll get it for you.

328
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,400
Okay?

329
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,240
It's not even dark yet.

330
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
After we finish eating,

331
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
are we going to watch something at home?

332
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Ink, you're not in a
hurry to go back, right?

333
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Uh...

334
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,840
No, I'm not in a hurry.

335
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
There's a new series out today.

336
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,840
Want to watch it together?

337
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,440
Sounds good.

338
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,520
Let's do it.

339
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,120
Hey,

340
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,360
Whoa!

341
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,600
Whose is this?

342
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,200
Mine.

343
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,080
Hello?

344
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, you're already at
the front of the house?

345
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,600
I'll come out to get you.

346
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,600
Hey everyone, this is Peach.

347
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,120
They just dropped by to surprise me.

348
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
So I invited them to
watch the movie with us.

349
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,840
Come on! The more people, the more fun.

350
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,640
Sure.

351
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,080
Let's keep watching.

352
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,160
Are you okay?

353
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,440
Um.

354
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,760
P' Yu!

355
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,400
You almost gave me a heart attack.

356
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,880
Sorry, it's my phone.

357
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,160
I need to take this call for a bit.

358
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,000
Sorry, sorry.

359
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
Where are you going?

360
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,360
Just a quick work call.

361
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,240
I'll be right back.

362
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,080
Just a moment.

363
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,240
Hello?

364
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes, Goodbye.

365
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,680
Thank you.

366
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,520
Yes.

367
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,200
Who is it?

368
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,680
It's me, Ai.

369
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Come on in.

370
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
So you're hiding here.

371
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Sorry,

372
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
a client called with an urgent job.

373
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,760
Hmm.

374
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Aren't you watching the movie anymore?

375
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,240
Nope.

376
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,280
Why not?

377
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,880
What are you looking at?

378
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,200
Can't I look?

379
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Hmm.

380
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
Do you want to stay with me?

381
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,560
Huh?

382
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,600
Are you afraid of ghosts?

383
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm not afraid.

384
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,360
You should go back to work.

385
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,760
Go on.

386
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Boo!

387
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,000
You're lucky your condo is near Peach's.

388
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Otherwise, you'd still not be home by now.

389
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Hey,

390
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
why did you turn off the car?

391
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,480
Didn't I tell you?

392
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
I have practice tomorrow.

393
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,320
Come practice with me.

394
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,360
No.

395
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Don't act all sly to stay in my room,

396
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,960
and drag me to practice with you.

397
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,080
Come on, you usually go everywhere with me.

398
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,120
I don't have class tomorrow,

399
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,160
and I don't want to go to campus.

400
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,160
Please, please, please.

401
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,000
Ing, would you really
abandon your friend Yo?

402
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,720
Come with me, and I'll
treat you to a meal tomorrow.

403
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
Okay?

404
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
Why don't you invite your young lover?

405
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,240
Young lover...

406
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,080
Do you mean Peach?

407
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
He gets hot easily, and besides,

408
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,160
Peach and I are just like siblings.

409
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,080
Just like siblings.

410
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,560
What kind of siblings are you?

411
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,880
Siblings who chat, get to know each other,

412
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,200
and understand each other.

413
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,680
Are you serious about this one?

414
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,040
Well...

415
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
we're just getting to know each other.

416
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,840
No need to rush into being serious, right?

417
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,440
Are you okay?

418
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,800
No, I'm just tired.

419
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,200
You can go now.

420
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,600
Wait.

421
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
What about me staying over at your place?

422
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,120
Hey!

423
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,840
What's with him?

424
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,440
Ok.

425
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,440
Hmm?

426
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,840
Well?

427
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,680
It looks so much better.

428
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,280
Do you want to try changing angles?

429
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,880
We just took horizontal photos, right?

430
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Go ahead and take the shot.

431
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,360
P' Yu,

432
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,200
come teach me.

433
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Sure.

434
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
It's not...

435
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,840
It's not working at all.

436
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,280
What if we want a different color?

437
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Huh?

438
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,600
A different color?

439
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,960
This color, right?

440
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,400
One, two, three.

441
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,560
Do you want to try
shooting with a film camera?

442
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,720
Do you have one?

443
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,240
Yeah, do you want to try?

444
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,040
Sure.

445
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,080
Here, give it a try.

446
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,240
But you need to look through it.

447
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,960
Wanna try?

448
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,440
Let's switch.

449
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,760
One, two...

450
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
It's slightly to the left, it'll look nice.

451
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Here.

452
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Thanks.

453
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Are you tired today?

454
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,600
It was fun.

455
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,360
Wow, this is so much more fun
than learning in the classroom.

456
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,960
When I was in class, I almost fell asleep.

457
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,680
Look,

458
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,720
I can't believe I took this photo.

459
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,600
I told you you could do it, see?

460
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,720
You have a good teacher.

461
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
So confident.

462
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,160
Of course.

463
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
So, after we're done,
where are you going next?

464
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,520
Might go home, I guess.

465
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay.

466
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,640
Where are you going, P' Yu?

467
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm planning to go develop the film.

468
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,160
Develop the film?

469
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,520
Can I come along?

470
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,840
The darkroom is really dark.

471
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,800
If you're there, it's okay with me.

472
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,880
I didn't mean it like that.

473
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,280
I mean, if someone is with me, it's fine.

474
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,400
It's probably not that dark, right?

475
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,440
Close the door.

476
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,000
Come on.

477
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,400
You can open your eyes now.

478
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,400
Whoa.

479
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,160
Can you handle it?

480
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
I can.

481
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,520
If not, then...

482
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
you can hold onto my hand

483
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,280
or not.

484
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,440
Do you want to try
developing the film yourself?

485
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,040
I want to,

486
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
but I'm afraid I might ruin your photos.

487
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,720
You won't ruin them.

488
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,240
It's really easy. Give it a try.

489
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,320
This tray is called a fixer,
or the stabilizer solution.

490
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,200
You take the photo from this tray

491
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,040
and rinse it in the tray with plain water.

492
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,000
Give it a try.

493
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,880
Is it clean?

494
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,680
It's clean, now you can hang it up to dry.

495
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,560
Here.

496
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,600
Hang it up to dry.

497
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
Oh, right.

498
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I haven't asked you yet,

499
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,080
why did you take me to the church?

500
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,280
I thought you would take
me to a more beautiful place.

501
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,160
At first, I had several places in mind.

502
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,680
But...

503
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,920
the assignment was to find a place
that represents us the most.

504
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,480
Um.

505
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,920
So I thought,

506
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,800
if there's a place that
represents me the most,

507
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,600
it would be here.

508
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,720
That makes sense.

509
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,920
What do you think?

510
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,720
You've got the brains of the family.

511
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
Are you ok?

512
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,480
When you asked me to help,

513
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,400
I didn't expect to have
to carry so much stuff.

514
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,480
And you woke me up so early.

515
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,720
Give it here, I'll carry it myself.

516
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,240
It's okay.

517
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm just complaining for the sake of it.

518
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,000
Hmm.

519
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,880
You said it yourself.

520
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,960
Just a moment, please.

521
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,560
Yu,

522
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
what are you doing here?

523
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,720
I have a photo shoot here.

524
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,280
Oh, Panpan!

525
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,600
You look so beautiful in that outfit today,
did you know that?

526
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,280
Thank you.

527
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Oh, Ice, this is Yu.

528
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,680
He's a...

529
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
a photographer who has
taken photos for me before.

530
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,160
Nice to meet you.

531
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm Ice.

532
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,520
Nice to meet you. I'm Yu.

533
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
Sorry, excuse me.

534
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,280
Can I take some
behind-the-scenes shots, please?

535
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,120
Sure, of course.

536
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,920
Right over here.

537
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,520
How do you feel about
today's promotional photoshoot?

538
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, it's our first day
appearing on a show together.

539
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,720
Frankly, I just want to say
that Panpan is very cute.

540
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
Being with her makes me happy.

541
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,680
We are the newest and hottest couple.

542
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,680
So please follow and support us.

543
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,680
Yes, we both prepared very well for today.

544
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,600
We hope that the photoshoot
today...

545
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,480
will come out beautiful
and cute for everyone to see.

546
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,160
Please follow and support us.

547
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,280
Yes, please follow and support us.

548
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,160
Let's start. Ready?

549
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Ready? One, two, three.

550
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,040
Great.

551
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,360
Keep posing.

552
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,240
Good.

553
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,640
Now, try leaning on the shoulder.

554
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,120
One, two.

555
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,360
Great, great.

556
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,880
One, two.

557
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,000
Keep going.

558
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,040
You're doing great.

559
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,160
Come on.

560
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,920
One, two.

561
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,600
One, two.

562
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Thanks a lot for helping me out today.

563
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,120
P' Yu,

564
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,360
are you okay these days?

565
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,680
And if I say I'm okay,

566
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,600
you'll know I'm lying, right?

567
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,400
If you're not okay,

568
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,960
If you're not okay,

569
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
you don't have to pretend to be fine.

570
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Even though I might
not be able to help much,

571
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,560
but I'm a good listener.

572
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Hmm.

573
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,320
You're growing up and acting so mature now.

574
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,960
You know how to say things like this.

575
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,320
Oh, P' Yu!

576
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
If you're not okay,

577
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,600
let me know.

578
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,680
Hmm.

579
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,160
Hey, P' Yu,

580
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
want to go for some grilled pork tomorrow?

581
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,120
Huh?

582
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,240
What's with the sudden mood?

583
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,680
I just want to eat it.

584
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,360
I'll pay for the meal.

585
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,440
Wow, what's with you today?

586
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,920
Are you going or not?

587
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,840
Of course,

588
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,680
if you invite me like this, I have to go.

589
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,320
But why are you being so nice to me today?

590
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,240
You were so quick with your answer!

591
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,680
So, I'll see you tomorrow, P' Yu.

592
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,520
Yes, see you tomorrow.

593
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,320
Yes!

594
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,600
Thank you.

595
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,600
Ah!

596
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,640
Hey! Hey!

597
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,200
Oh, sorry about that.

598
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,440
You can get a new piece.

599
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,080
Ouch!

600
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,520
It's not cooked yet.

601
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,520
Oops!

602
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,200
Oops!

603
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,000
Yo!

604
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,920
Hey, it's edible!

605
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,320
No, it's not, Yo.

606
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,360
Hey, Yo, there's more here.

607
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Excuse me, excuse me.

608
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,200
Excuse me, we've arrived.

609
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,320
We've arrived.

610
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,040
Sorry about that. Here you go.

611
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,760
Sure.

612
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,240
What's wrong?

613
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,160
Yo? Tell me what happened.

614
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,880
Yo!

615
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
P' Yu probably won't
be coming back tonight.

616
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,960
What do you mean?

617
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,160
(Please apologize to Ai for me,
I couldn't keep my promise.)

618
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,080
P' Yu.

619
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,960
(Next Episode)
Let's go find P' Yu.

620
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,880
You don't have to.

621
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,040
When he thinks too much, he's like this.

622
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,000
But this time it wasn't
like the other times.

623
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Hey, Here it is, I found it.

624
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,040
It's here!

625
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,400
How do you know it's here?

626
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,880
If P' Yu isn't here, I don't
even know where he will be.

627
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,400
We haven't seen him.

628
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,280
What should we do?

629
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,320
P' Yu!

630
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,760
Ai! Where are you going?

631
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,760
P' Yu!

632
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
P' Yu!!
