00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,600
This series is purely a work of fiction,

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,000
and is not related to actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,120
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Are you alright?

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,120
Ow!

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,240
P' Yu, Where are you?

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm at the park.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,320
Hey!

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,080
Get off!

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,000
Huh?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,720
Wanna get it?

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Hey!

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,520
P' Yu.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Are you okay?

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,600
Hey!

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,240
P' Yu!

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,880
Hey!

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Stay here.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,480
Stay with me tonight.

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,320
Why?

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,400
We used to sleep together when we were kids.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
The dreams you had, I'm jealous of it.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,240
If I had dreamed about any accident,

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,920
I would have stopped it from happening.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,720
P' Yu!

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,800
P' Yu!

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,560
P' Yu!

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,160
P' Yu.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,760
Did you have a bad dream?

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
You hugged me so tightly.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,800
Who hugged you?

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't hug.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
Didn't hug what? I just saw that you...

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,960
I didn't hug you.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,920
Okay, okay, you didn't hug, you didn't hug.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't get mad.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,080
Lie down, I'll wipe you down.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,400
Why?

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm not sick.

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,480
You're not sick? You're burning up.

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Then I'll go take a shower myself.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,880
How can you take a shower by yourself?

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,000
If your wound gets wet and gets worse,
what will you do?

44
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Do you want to go to the doctor?

45
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
Lie down, I'll wipe you down.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,760
Quickly.

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,680
Come on.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,280
P' Yu.

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
Huh?

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,720
Are you okay lately?

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,280
Why, do I look sick?

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
No, not that.

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,480
I mean, like...

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,720
Are you tired lately or is there something...

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,440
or is there something...

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
No.

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,400
Why?

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,320
Hmm.

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
P' Yu.

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,200
Huh?

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,520
I'll continue this myself.

62
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay, okay.

63
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Then I'll go prepare the meal downstairs.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,440
When you're done, come down.

65
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh.

66
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,760
Hey, I prepared some porridge for you.

67
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,920
You can eat it right away.

68
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,720
Are you expecting something in return?

69
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
I have nothing to repay you with.

70
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm not expecting anything.

71
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,600
Didn't you say that if you see someone in trouble,

72
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,760
we should rush to help them?

73
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
How could I not help when you're sick?

74
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,520
Thank you.

75
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
It's delicious, right?

76
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
It's from my favorite place.

77
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,680
Panpan likes it too.

78
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Aren't you going to answer it?

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
P'Pan's calling.

80
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,800
Pan,

81
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,240
Wait a second.

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
Is there something else you need to talk about, Yu?

83
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,360
Pan, are you really going to choose this?

84
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Why wouldn't I choose this?

85
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,800
You know how much this show means to me.

86
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
I'll be thirty soon, Yu.

87
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,200
You know my chances in the industry are very slim now.

88
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,960
This show might be my only chance to finally become famous.

89
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you understand, Yu?

90
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,960
Pan.

91
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
We have to break up, Pan.

92
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,800
And what do you want me to do, Yu?

93
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
It's a dating reality show.

94
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
If people know I already have a boyfriend,

95
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,240
who would believe the show?

96
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,680
I would.

97
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,880
I believe you, Pan, that...

98
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
You don't have to go on a show like this.

99
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,760
You can become famous on your own.

100
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
Do you really believe that, Yu?

101
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
Just believing isn't enough.

102
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
You know, you've seen it all along,

103
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,600
that I've tried so hard.

104
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
I've tried all the time,

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,160
but I'm still not famous.

106
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
And this is my dream.

107
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,000
Your dream, Pan?

108
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,880
All this time,

109
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,680
have I never been part of your dream?

110
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,800
I've thought it through and decided on this.

111
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,200
Anyway, don't forget to sign the confidentiality agreement

112
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,920
that the show sent for you to sign.

113
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,120
I can call her back later.

114
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,040
Uh, P' Yu.

115
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Do you have any plans....

116
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
to go to the beach anytime soon?

117
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
The beach?

118
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,680
No, I don't.

119
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,840
Not even a bit?

120
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, Ai, I've been so busy lately, you know that.

121
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I'll probably be stuck in the studio every day.

122
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Why?

123
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,360
Do you want to go?

124
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
No, nothing.

125
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
That's good, you'll save money.

126
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
You should answer the call since
it's ringing so much.

127
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,560
Okay, I'll be right back.

128
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,080
(Ai: Come to my house.)

129
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,280
Huh? You dreamed that P' Yu was drowning?

130
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,400
Are you serious?

131
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes, it's true.

132
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,000
When and where?

133
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,680
Try to think carefully about

134
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,080
what you saw in the dream.

135
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,800
I only saw that...

136
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,040
it was some beach.

137
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
But I asked P' Yu already,

138
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,880
and he has no plans to go anywhere.

139
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Where is Yu now?

140
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,640
At work.

141
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,960
He said he's in the studio.

142
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,320
When did you have the dream?

143
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,720
Last night.

144
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,560
Everytime you dream about what happens,

145
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,320
how long apart are they?

146
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,520
About a day or two.

147
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
So, don't stress out yet.

148
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,960
It's not certain.

149
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,720
But what about you?

150
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
How's your arm after getting cut by that robber?

151
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,080
It's...

152
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,360
okay now,

153
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,840
but it still hurts a little.

154
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,800
You,

155
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,240
always getting hurt.

156
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm leaving now.

157
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,840
Where are you going?

158
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,000
I have class, need to go change.

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,040
You have class too, right?

160
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,640
Are you going?

161
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,400
No.

162
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Fine, I'll go then.

163
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
Call me if anything comes up.

164
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,720
See you.

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,680
Umm.

166
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,120
P' Yu, open the door for me, please.

167
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,240
P' Yu.

168
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,920
P' Yu.

169
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,040
P' Yu.

170
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,400
Can you open the door?

171
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,120
What?

172
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Can I sleep with you tonight?

173
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,920
Why?

174
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,320
Ai...

175
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,000
Come on.

176
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
Just a sec.

177
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,680
Can I sleep with the lights on?

178
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,360
P' Yu!

179
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,080
P' Yu!

180
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh, you're awake.

181
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Where did you go?

182
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,240
I went to shower.

183
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm going to go to work now.

184
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
Why?

185
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

186
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,680
Are you ok?

187
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
Could you give me a ride today?

188
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,280
But you normally don't have any classes today.

189
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,520
Why would you...

190
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,840
But today I'm the only one who has class.

191
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Don't leave yet.

192
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,720
Wait for me, okay?

193
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,880
Umm.

194
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Are you having class in this building?

195
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Yes, I have class in this building.

196
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
Alright, study hard.

197
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,840
P' Yu.

198
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Huh?

199
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
Are you working all day today?

200
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes, all day. Why?

201
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,000
Nothing, nothing.

202
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
Where are you working?

203
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,880
Here...

204
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Oh, then you can just text me.

205
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,840
Okay, okay.

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,960
See you.

207
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,160
(So where are you working again?)

208
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,440
Alright, kids. Welcome to Photography 101.

209
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
Today, we have a special guest.

210
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,280
Please welcome.

211
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Hello, students.

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm P' Yu.

213
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
Hello. / Hello.

214
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
P' Yu is currently a freelance photographer.

215
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,040
Today, he will teach us some photography techniques.

216
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
Let me introduce myself again.

217
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm a freelance photographer.

218
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
My name is Yu.

219
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,360
Let's get to the first exercise.

220
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,480
Everyone, take a look at this picture first.

221
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,160
What technique do you think this picture uses?

222
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Everyone, pick up your cameras.

223
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,960
Try guessing through your own lens.

224
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,440
Can anyone answer?

225
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,440
This is the Golden Ratio technique.

226
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,080
You can see that the shape resembles a spiral.

227
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
So we can see that the focus point,

228
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,400
is at the end of the spiral.

229
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,640
How's that?

230
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,720
Alright.

231
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Turn on your screen.

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,680
Let's give P' Yu a round of applause.

233
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,520
Thank you very much, P' Yu,

234
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,240
for coming to give a lecture.

235
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,840
I have a small assignment for you.

236
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,160
Next time, you need to submit your final project.

237
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,760
The topic is a photograph that tells your own story.

238
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,400
Please put effort into it.

239
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,040
Because these photos will determine your grade, whether you pass or not.

240
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,440
If you don't pass, you might have to retake the class.

241
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,560
Class dismissed for today.

242
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Thank you.

243
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,960
Thank you so much.

244
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,600
Ai.

245
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,240
Ai.

246
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,400
What?

247
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm going home.

248
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
This class...

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,360
Yeah! I failed this class,

250
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,280
so I'm sitting here alone.

251
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,800
Well, I don't like taking pictures!

252
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Come on, come! Make fun of me!

253
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,440
I haven't said anything yet.

254
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,480
I was just going to ask you that after class,

255
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,800
do you want to go home with me?

256
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,040
Do you need my help for this class?

257
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I can help you pass.

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, I don't want to owe any favors.

259
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,240
How about this?

260
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
I'll help you pass this class,

261
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,240
but in return, you have to help me with my work for one day.

262
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay?

263
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,240
I guarantee you'll pass for sure.

264
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,840
A hundred percent guarantee.

265
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,640
Alright.

266
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,000
Okay, Deal.

267
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,600
Are you going home now?

268
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,800
Let me grab my stuff first.

269
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,480
Hey, wait.

270
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,760
Ai, Ai.

271
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,320
Hey Ai.

272
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,600
Are you almost done?

273
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
P' Yu is waiting to eat.

274
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,840
Hmm, it might take a while.

275
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,800
Ouch.

276
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,400
Are you okay?

277
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,920
Ai, Ai, are you alright?

278
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,080
One hit and you're down.

279
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,160
Oh, it's nothing.

280
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
I'm fine.

281
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,560
I'm really sorry.

282
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,320
Does it hurt a lot?

283
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,880
He's fine.

284
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,240
A person like him can take it.

285
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,560
(Shut up.)

286
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,320
By the way, what are you doing here?

287
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,200
Oh, he came to invite me to eat.

288
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
P' Yu is waiting.

289
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,480
To eat?

290
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,800
That means P' Yu is paying?

291
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm going to go home now.

292
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,040
See you.

293
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,880
See you.

294
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,960
Are you ok?

295
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,480
Are you ok?

296
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,320
It's ok.

297
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,320
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,760
Please excuse me.
