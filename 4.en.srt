This series is purely a work of fiction

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and is not related to any actual persons,
places, organizations, or events.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.280
(Previously)
Do you need my help for this class?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.520
I can help you pass.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440
But in return, you have to help me
with my work for one day.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.240
Okay.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.240
When you asked me to help,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.160
I didn't expect to have
to carry so much stuff.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.840
Yu.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.880
Ice, this is Yu.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.440
He's...

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.640
a photographer who has
taken photos for me before.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.800
Are you okay these days?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760
P' Yu probably won't
be coming back tonight.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.320
What do you mean?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.920
Yo,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.040
what happened? Tell me.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.840
Yo!!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.000
P' Yu probably won't
be coming back tonight.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.640
What do you mean?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920
(Please apologize to Ai for me,
I couldn't keep my promise.)

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.600
P' Yu!!!

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160
Hey, why are you so shocked?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000
I saw you crying, why are you crying?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.960
Look, the series is so sad.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.920
Gene and Nubsib broke up.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
Oh my God, Yo.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.560
Why are you so stressed about this?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600
"I Saw You in My Dream"
(Episode 4)

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.880
Have you been starving or what?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.480
Why are you yelling at me?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.240
What? I can't criticize you now?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.840
Hey, do you think P' Yu disappeared

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.640
because he had a fight with Panpan?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.960
How do you know that?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.160
Did P' Yu tell you?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.120
Yeah, he told me when I was
helping him with some work.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.240
He said they fought about
something related to the show.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.200
Something about an old relationship
or a new one, I don't really know.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.520
Or do you know something?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.160
Oh,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.920
after your birthday party,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.400
I had to pee so I went
outside to use the bathroom.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360
And suddenly I heard P'
Yu arguing with Panpan.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.960
Hey, I'm not being nosy.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.720
But I heard them arguing loudly.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.040
So I got curious and worried.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.080
I wanted to know what
they were fighting about.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.360
(Why aren't you answering?)

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.960
(Why are you silent?)

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.120
(It's not related, Pan.)

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.840
(Hey, wait a minute, Pan.)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.120
(We still need to talk about this.)

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.960
Oh, Yo.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.280
I'm heading home now.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.520
Ok.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.240
Pan!

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.600
Aren't you worried about P' Yu?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.320
I think we should go look for him.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.960
No need, P' Yu will be back by tomorrow.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.920
He always acts like this
when he's overthinking.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.400
You've seen this before, right?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.560
But this time, it's different.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.360
How so?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.040
Ugh.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.920
Well, maybe it's not so different.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.680
Have you ever seen P'Yu
break up with someone?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.680
As far as I know,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.720
Panpan is P' Yu's first girlfriend, right?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.240
How are we supposed to know

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680
where P' Yu is?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.240
Oh, I think I got it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.080
Hey, hi.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.680
Hi.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.320
Hello.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.040
(Ai: I just entered the wardrobe room.)

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.440
(Ai: I can't find Panpan.)

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.160
(Ing: I haven't found her either.)

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.720
(Yo: Yeah, me neither.)

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.400
Are you the wardrobe assistant?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.400
Yes.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.800
Can you please bring P' Ice's and
P' Pan's shoes to the set right now?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.600
Why are you just standing there?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.400
They're about to start
filming, I need them now.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.520
Uh, okay.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.320
Alright.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.160
Hold on a second.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.560
Well?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.520
Yes.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.080
Can you?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.480
If you can find it, then follow me.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.360
Uh...

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.600
Well? Do you have it?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.800
Yes.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.920
Okay.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.800
Go ahead.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.440
They're about to start, hurry.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.120
Go in.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.400
Hey,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.840
these aren't my shoes.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.560
Did you grab the right pair?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.720
Did you bring the wrong shoes?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.800
Which pair is it, then?

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.960
I'll get someone else to bring them.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.360
Answer when you're asked.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.760
Are we going to shoot today or not?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.160
I need the wardrobe team on set now.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.280
Hey?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.600
What's going on, Opal?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.040
The assistant brought the wrong shoes.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.960
I asked him something,
and he didn't respond.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.440
Opal, I only have one assistant
and we were just making papaya salad.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.280
Who are you?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.520
Hey?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
Hey, you?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.720
Ai.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.960
Why are you doing things like this?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.040
If the film crew catches you
and you don't find me first...

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.200
what if they caught you
and sent you to the police?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.480
I'm sorry,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.680
but we just wanted to talk to you.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.440
I called, but you didn't answer.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.800
I texted, but you didn't reply.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.400
If you want to talk about Yu,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.320
I'm not ready to discuss it right now.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.880
We can't wait.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.080
It's urgent.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.520
What do you mean?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.880
Has something happened, Ai?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.960
P' Yu is missing.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.840
Didn't you know?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.680
Uh... the truth is

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.960
I've broken up with Yu
for quite some time time.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.560
Then can I ask you one last question?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.200
What is it?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.480
Did you and P' Yu ever
go to the ocean together?

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.200
Um...

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.240
I've never been to the sea with Yu.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.400
Why are you asking?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.120
Oh, it's nothing.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.000
Sorry for bothering you.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.280
It's ok.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.200
I'm sorry.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.680
Do you think...

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.040
P' Yu is ok?

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.560
Hey, don't go thinking about that yet.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.600
Why did you ask P' Pan about the sea?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.720
Never mind.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.680
Have you ever gone to the sea with P' Yu?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.200
Yeah, I have.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.600
I went to Jeju Island,
Bali, and the Maldives.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.320
Oh, this is hard.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.400
Nami, Hokkaido, Hawaii.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.000
Wait, you've been to all those places?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.720
No, I just want to go.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.120
Damn it, I'm being serious here.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.360
Hey, I think I know one place.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.840
Hold on.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.800
Ai, did you dream about
P' Yu being at the sea?

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.800
Hey, how did you know?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.280
You always come to this conclusion.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.800
Hey, here it is! Here it is!

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.400
I found it.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.920
Where is that?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:11.840
It's here.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.960
How do you know it's here?

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.960
Oh, just look at the
picture, it's the same.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.200
That's not what I meant.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.560
I mean, how do you know P' Yu is here?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.160
Well, if P' Yu isn't here,
then I don't know where else he could be.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.480
Because this is the place that...

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.160
I think we should find P' Yu first.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.240
It's getting late.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.440
Let's go.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.400
Over there, right?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.600
Yeah, let's check it out first.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.400
It looks similar, right?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.160
Yeah.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.360
Is there another spot like this?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.640
I don't think so.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.560
It should end here.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.600
Or should we try over there?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.560
Yeah, let's give it a try.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.080
Try again.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.640
Um.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.120
What should we do?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.240
What should we do?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.440
Yeah, Which way should we go?

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.280
Or should we try that way?

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.680
Oh.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.280
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.360
Whoever loses goes that way.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.520
Come on.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.040
Okay.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.560
Alright, come on.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.280
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.760
Alright, I'm going that way.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.800
Follow me.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.440
I think we should go to the reception.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.240
Yeah, let's go.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.080
Hello.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.040
Hi.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.480
How can I help you?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.480
I wanted to ask if you've
seen this man before.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960
Hmm... no, I haven't.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.560
You've never seen him?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.680
Yes.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.640
Is there something wrong?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.080
No, nothing.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.280
Thank you.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.080
Thank you.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.520
I think we should go look outside.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.880
Yeah.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040
We can't find him anywhere.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.080
What do we do, Ai?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.120
I don't know.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.600
P' Yu.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.600
P' Yu.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.360
P' Yu.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.600
P' Yu!

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.720
Hey, Ai, where are you going?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.840
P' Yu.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.680
P' Yu.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.840
P' Yu, what are you doing there?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.560
Oh, Ai.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.560
Hey.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.840
P' Yu.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.960
Hey, Ai.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.280
Go.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.900
How did everyone get here?

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.860
What were you about to do, P' Yu?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.940
P' Yu, were you trying to commit suicide?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.780
Huh?

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.780
Commit suicide?

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.780
Why would you think I was
trying to commit suicide?

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.380
We saw you just now.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.340
It looked like you were
trying to kill yourself.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.700
Let's talk more in the room.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.060
Huh?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.820
You weren't trying to kill myself?!

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:28.860
Yeah.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.580
Then why did you think I
was trying to commit suicide?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.460
Well, you broke up with Panpan.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.740
And just now, seeing you standing there,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.020
we thought you were going to kill yourself.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:38.620
Wait,

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.500
how did you know I broke up with Panpan?

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.340
Well, you disappeared for so long.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.500
So we went to find P' Panpan

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.580
and found out you two broke up.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.700
But I sent a message about it.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.580
Right, Ai,

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.740
you made me panic for nothing.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.380
What?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.500
You don't have to scold him.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.140
He was just worried about his P' Yu.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.180
Who's worried?

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.540
You weren't?

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.340
You jumped in after me like that.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.940
How did you know I was here?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.260
When are you coming back?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.740
Hmm... probably for a while.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.900
I was thinking of staying a bit longer.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.660
Honestly, you all can go back first.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.340
No, you have to come back with me.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.220
If you won't go back
then I won't go back either.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.580
Why not?

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.300
Just because.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.700
Fine.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.740
Ai...

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.300
Ai...

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.540
What?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.860
Why do I have to sleep over with you?

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.300
Aren't you worried about me?

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.540
What?

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.980
I'm not worried.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.900
Anyone could tell from this afternoon

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.300
that you were worried about me.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.060
I said I wasn't worried,
so I'm not worried.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.260
Fine, fine.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.500
You're not worried about.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.020
Then I'm going to the bridge.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.180
P' Yu, no!

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.220
See? You're worried about me again.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.180
Yeah, I'm worried about you. Happy?

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.140
Not very much.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.100
Then what do I have to do?

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.460
You have to...

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.900
Enough, stop it.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.700
I'm going to sleep now.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.220
Do you know how exhausting
it is to dive in and help?

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.380
Aren't you going to talk first?

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.060
Um.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.740
Just sleep, P' Yu.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.860
Alright, I'm sleeping.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.220
Ouch.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.500
Why aren't you sleeping with your brother?

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.780
Ai is really worried about P' Yu.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.060
So I'm letting them stare
at each other all night.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.060
So now I have to suffer and sleep with you?

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.780
Are you going to leave me by
the roadside like a stray dog?

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.940
Come on, let me sleep here.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.820
Don't even try to sneak in, you.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.900
So mean.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.540
Alright, you can sleep
here because I'm being kind.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.700
Yay, I'm going to sleep
now, no holding back.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.460
(Peach)

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.700
Why aren't you answering?

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.420
Your little Peach made
an effort to call you.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.820
I think I'm going to stop talking to Peach.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.580
I don't want to talk to anyone anymore.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.500
Why?

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.060
Peach wants something serious with me.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.780
But I'm not ready for that right now.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.100
How so?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.180
Someone like me,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.620
I can't stay serious with anyone for long.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.540
But having just you is fine.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.260
I don't want to deal with you.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.500
Always avoiding problems.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.380
Really, darling?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.540
Don't call me darling.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.220
So comfortable.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.260
Move over a bit more.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.460
Come on, I'm about to fall off the bed.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:43.940
Where do you want me to move?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.460
Huh?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.540
Are you going to sleep or not?

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.980
Can you find a mattress
for me to sleep on the floor?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.020
If you're going to sleep, be quiet.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.060
Hey,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.100
Just be quiet.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.020
I might snore tonight.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.180
Go to sleep.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.020
Put up with my snoring.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.820
P' Yu.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.540
(Ah, Khun Yu and Khun Panpan, )

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.540
(What's your current status?)

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.420
(We're still very much in love as usual.)

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.140
(We haven't broken up.)

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.660
(Yes, that's right. We're very much in love.)

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.340
(And we're falling more
and more in love everyday.)

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.300
(Panpan: Yes, and I think that there's no way)

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.780
(we'll ever break up. Absolutely no way.)

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.740
(Oh, with such a sweet
and loving relationship, )

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.140
(Do you have any honeymoon plans?)

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.500
(Can we discuss this off the record?
I don't want to tell Panpan about it.)

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.140
(Why? What is it?)

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.020
(I can't say, it's a secret.)

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.260
P' Yu.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.140
P' Yu.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.460
Ai.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.660
Ai.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.300
Wake up, everyone's already gone.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.580
And the gold medal goes to…

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.500
Yo Yospol Silpakarnsakul!

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.420
Yay!

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.100
Congratulations.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.780
One, two, three.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.460
Yay!

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.700
You did great, kiddo.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.860
Wow, a gold medal.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.540
Great job, Yo.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.220
Surprise!

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.420
Ohho.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.100
What did you buy?

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.340
Oh wow! A brand new one?

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.140
That's right, you got it, you deserve it.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.140
Good job, my little puppy.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.340
Dad, don't call me that.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.020
It's embarrassing.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.820
Embarrassing?
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.460
You're so talented, we should celebrate.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.500
We'll definitely celebrate

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.420
once you and Mom are
back from your honeymoon

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.540
anniversary trip.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.020
Oh, you always have
moments like this every year.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.420
Okay, okay, we promise.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.020
We'll come back soon and
have a big celebration together.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.020
Okay?

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:13.900
Okay.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.060
Promise?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.020
Promise.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.940
Promise too!

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.300
Promise.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.100
I think Yu should get your
camera to take a picture.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.940
Yes.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.260
Dad will take it.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.340
Selfie time. Ready? Ready.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.980
Ready? One, two, three.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.660
Go ahead, take your shot.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.300
Just keep playing.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.460
Yo, focus on your homework.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.900
Focus on your homework.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.420
Yeah.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.100
If Mom and Dad come back, I'll tell on you.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.300
Tattletale.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.340
Tattletale.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.140
Yep, I'm a tattletale.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.060
Don't.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.980
Focus on your homework, Yo.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:46.980
It's mine!

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.580
Yo, focus on your homework.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.740
Tell on me then.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.020
Go focus on your homework.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.580
Okay, okay.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.180
Hello.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.780
Hello.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.020
Yu,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.020
Yo,

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.860
your parents have passed away.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:14.300
P' Yu, why didn't Mom and Dad
come back like they promised?

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.660
Mom... Dad...

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.820
P' Yu, do you know...

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.940
when you fell into the water,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.780
I got so scared.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.780
And there was a moment...

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.580
That I felt like...

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.540
you weren't coming back, like mom and dad.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.780
From now it's only us...

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.740
can you promise me

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:08.580
that you won't disappear like that again?

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.620
I'm sorry Yo.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.300
I promise,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.740
I won't disappear like that again.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.740
I'm sorry.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.500
Good thing P' Yu didn't actually
think about committing suicide.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.820
Yeah, it's a relief it
wasn't as bad as I thought.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.020
It's weird, huh?

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.340
Last time, you dreamed about P' Yu.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.980
This time, you also
dreamed about P' Yu or...

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.700
Or what?

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.100
In my first dream, P' Yu wasn't even in it.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.580
But P' Yu was the one who helped you,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.780
even got hurt for you.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.420
Maybe you and P' Yu...

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.100
have some connection.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.820
You're delusional.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.300
Me and P' Yu?

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.620
How would I know?

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.740
It's your dreams.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.380
Connected to dreams?

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.460
You're eating and making a mess like a kid.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.340
Mind your business, P' Yu.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:57.900
Here,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.340
have some snacks to keep your mouth shut.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:01.860
Whoa.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.220
Isn't this too much?

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.860
Good, so you'll be quiet.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.740
Tasty, right?

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.100
Water.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.700
P' Yu, can you drop me off at home?

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.740
It's on the way.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.420
Sure, just tell me the directions.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.620
Okay, Thanks.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.060
Are you heading home?

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.900
I can miss my mom too, can't I?

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.140
You have your cute moments too.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.380
Cute, my foot.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.700
What, you want to eat more?

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.020
Oww.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.060
Take it easy.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.020
Oh, here they come.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.780
Oh, they're back.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.020
Alright, let's step aside.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.540
So tired.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.820
What mood are you in to
come out and play badminton?

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.100
Well, the kids ran off to have fun,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.420
so the parents need to
find something to do too.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.700
Oh, acting all sulky now.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.100
Want to play with us, kids?

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.340
Sure, bring it on.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.220
Could you hold this for a while?

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.340
You have to be on my side.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.220
Alright.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:28.900
You go over there, Yo.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.300
Then I won't hold back, Father Mhok.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.660
Take that!

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.060
Ah, show them.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.380
Go!

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.140
I'll count for you guys,
it's one point for each team now.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.100
Dad!

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.740
I'm getting tired from jumping!

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.660
(24 - 48 hours)

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.020
(Things floated)

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:06.900
(Recurring dream)

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.140
(Time has no effect)

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.620
(Did not happen)

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.500
(Event has not happened)

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.220
(Happened in reality)

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.180
(Did not happen)

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.300
(P' Yu)

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.660
(Ai)

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.860
(P' Yu)

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.940
(Next Episode)
You are so warm.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.740
Ai.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.780
I'll take you there.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.500
This is the fare.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.420
Take it quickly.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.100
This is my senior from the badminton club.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.620
Wann.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.100
Can we exchange contact info?

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.620
Damn.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.100
Why is he afraid of the dark?

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.860
I never asked him.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.620
It's me.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.460
Calm down.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.300
I'm sorry.
