1
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Someone once said,

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,960
when we sleep,

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
we are like a box being opened.

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,120
Because something in our subconscious

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
is expressed as images,

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,240
or what we all call dreams.

7
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,800
"I Saw You in My Dream"
(Episode 1)

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Wake up!

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,440
P' Yu, what are you doing?

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
Wake up!

11
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Everyone else is ready.

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,080
We're all waiting for you.

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
We're going to be late for church.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Damn it!!!

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
This is P' Yu,

16
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,562
The boy next door
who has been teasing me since I was a kid.

17
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Ow.

18
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
P' Yu, turn it off!

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,000
Why?

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Are you going to turn it off or not?

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
No.
Turn it off.

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,000
Or else I'm going to shoot.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Come on, shoot me.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
We're never going to be on good terms.

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
(You don't love me anymore?)

26
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:02,095
P' Yu, I told you that I'm
not watching it, I'm scared.

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,600
(You don't love me anymore?)

28
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,200
P' Yu.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
(You don't love me anymore?)

30
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
(You don't love me anymore?)

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
(You don't love...)

32
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Boo!

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,440
Arghhh!

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,440
P' Yu!!!

35
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,000
Serves you right!!

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,200
P' Yu?

37
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,240
P' Yu!

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,240
P' Yu!!

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,640
P' Yu!!!

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,160
P' Yu!!!!

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,640
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,200
I just wanted to get you wet.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
P' Yu!

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,120
P' Yu!

45
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
They call it a natural-born rivalry,

46
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
And I never managed to
prank him back, not even once.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,760
P' Yu,

48
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,651
Is this funny to you?

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
It's not bad, do you want to see?

50
00:04:14,324 --> 00:04:16,084
P' Yu, delete it.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,600
Filming others like this is illegal.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you know PPAP?

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,680
PPAP...

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
Do you mean PDPA?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
I must look so ugly!

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,600
It's pretty cute.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
P' Yu, delete it.

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,120
Trust me.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,680
Hey,

60
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,262
What are you looking at, Yo?

61
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,425
Get your brother out of here.

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,280
I'm taking you.

63
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Father Mark said to get on stage.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,360
Just a minute, just a minute.

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
(Joy to the world,)

67
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,600
(the Lord has come, let earth receive her King)

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,920
(Let every heart prepare Him room)

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,560
(And Heaven and nature sing,)

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
(And Heaven and nature sing)

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,560
(And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing)

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,840
(Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!)

73
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,360
(Let men their songs employ)

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,720
(While fields and floods,
rocks, hills and plains)

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,080
(Repeat the sounding joy)

76
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,200
(Repeat the sounding joy)

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,280
(Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy)

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,000
P' Yu.

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,680
(The fact that God is
willing to reveal His thoughts)

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
(and His will)

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
You're playing too much.

82
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
(The privilege of
receiving such revelations)

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,080
(Receiving such revelations)

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,720
(is one of the most important gifts)

85
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
You don't like it? I
thought it was pretty cute.

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
(that God gives to His children.)

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,712
Pretty scary.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
It's your birthday, you should stand out.

89
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:59,579
P' Yu!

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Shh, keep it down.

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,760
(Revelations come in many ways)

92
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Shh.

93
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
(such as dreams, visions)

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,040
(and conversations with heavenly
messengers and inspiration)

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,720
(Some revelations)

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,320
(are received immediately
with strong impact)

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,680
(and some are gradually
perceived subtly over time)

98
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
Why are you so upset?

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,760
It was just a prank.

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
Well, I'm embarrassed.

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,320
Why?

102
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
If you want to write something,
why don't you do it on your own face?

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Why would you write on others' faces?

104
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,633
Oh, enough already.

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
You two never stop fighting.

106
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,480
I was going to scold you at church.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,600
Look at P' Yu, Mom.

108
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
Look at P' Yu, Mom.

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,640
P' Yu,

110
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Oh,

111
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,640
Come on,

112
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,467
it's in the past.

113
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,396
Just let it go.

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
Wow, both Dad and Mom,

115
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,216
Why do you always take P' Yu's side?

116
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,440
Hey, did you forget what today is?

117
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,960
Hmm.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,720
And what do we have to do?

119
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:12,344
Huh?

120
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:14,295
Gifts!

121
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,140
Yeah.

122
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Oh wow.

123
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,820
Last year you already got an iPad.

124
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,500
You're getting another one this year?
Give me a break.

125
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,660
Because it's P' Yu, not me.

126
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,460
Alright, alright, all the
clues are in the house.

127
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:32,297
And the first clue is.

128
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:40,833
Round... and always hot.

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,420
Think fast!

130
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,220
We'll start in...

131
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:57,180
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go.

132
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,700
Go quickly.

133
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,300
Quickly.

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,420
I'll go first.

135
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,580
Let me see too!

136
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,860
No, P' Yu, go look over there.

137
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,340
Go look over there.

138
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,860
This spot is mine.

139
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,820
But if we look together, it'll be clearer.

140
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,100
Wouldn't it be better to help each other?

141
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,220
Have you checked the grey one?

142
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,660
(Round and always hot)

143
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:48,795
Wait.

144
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,300
No.

145
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,140
Let me in too!

146
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,060
Close it, close it now.

147
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,980
Don't.

148
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,020
Let me in too!

149
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,500
No way!

150
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,420
Let me in too!

151
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,940
P' Yu, let go.

152
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,420
Go to someone else.

153
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,500
Ai.

154
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,660
Hurry up, open it now.

155
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,700
P' Yu, go look over there.

156
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,540
Open it.

157
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,700
No, I won't open it anymore.

158
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,900
Go look somewhere else.

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,500
Cold and always wet,

160
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,551
Embracing and moist.

161
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,813
Bright and high up.

162
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,260
Dad, Mom, P' Yu, Ing.

163
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,780
Hey.

164
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,700
Are you okay?

165
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:02,421
Ai.

166
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,740
Hey, P' Yu, you're bleeding.

167
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,340
Happy birthday to you,

168
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,660
Happy birthday to you,

169
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,260
Happy birthday,

170
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,060
Happy birthday,

171
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,340
Happy birthday to you.

172
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,940
Hmm.

173
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
Make a wish.

174
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,980
Alright.

175
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,108
Happy birthday, son.

176
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,340
Happy birthday to you.

177
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,740
Have a very happy birthday.

178
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,260
Thanks.

179
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,820
You're twenty now, all grown up.

180
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,460
Thank you.

181
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,875
Your birthday gift this year,

182
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,140
You'll have to wait a bit for it.

183
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:48,902
Let's cut the cake.

184
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,797
Come on, I'm hungry.

185
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,512
P' Yu cheated.

186
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,340
Can't help it.

187
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,620
You're the one who let it go.

188
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,980
Mom!

189
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,100
Last year P' Yu already got an iPad.

190
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,864
This year he gets a PlayStation.

191
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,660
Why are you making a fuss?

192
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,300
You'll end up playing with him anyway.

193
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:21,711
You're right.

194
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,700
Hey, hey, no need to fuss.

195
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,860
Your birthday present.

196
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,220
We've prepared it,

197
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,060
it won't lose to a PlayStation.

198
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,380
Woah.

199
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,660
Here, happy birthday, Ai.

200
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,420
May you achieve success,

201
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,260
And whatever you want
to be, may you become.

202
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,220
Thank you, Dad.

203
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,220
Thank you.

204
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,660
Wait, wait, don't open it yet.

205
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,300
I've got something too.

206
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,980
Hey,

207
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,180
It's definitely a back scratcher.

208
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,940
Hey, Ing, don't spoil it.

209
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,220
Yo, anyone who can't guess it is an idiot.

210
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,660
Here, this is from me.

211
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Thanks.

212
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,860
Yours is definitely a book,

213
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:08,860
A hundred percent.

214
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,820
It's true.

215
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,940
I'll open this one first.

216
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,100
Let's go.

217
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,500
Wow, the hand is coming out.

218
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,140
It's so clear Dad.

219
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,580
Wow, you're good at guessing.

220
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,180
Who is it?

221
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,180
Ingmar Bergman.

222
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,900
He's my favorite director.

223
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,060
You don't know him?

224
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,140
I do.

225
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,860
They say he's great, right?

226
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,060
Thank you both so much,

227
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,980
for giving me gifts that are
absolutely useless to my life.

228
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,235
Now for the main event,

229
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm putting a lot of hope into this one.

230
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,580
Let's move on to Mom and Dad's gift.

231
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,860
I'll open it now.

232
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,940
Open it, open it.

233
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,580
Wow, this camera is really expensive.

234
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,220
Take a picture of Mom.

235
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,340
Come on.

236
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,620
Alright, Dad.

237
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,860
One, two...

238
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,460
Everyone, let's take a group photo.

239
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:13,700
Good, let's take a picture together.

240
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay.

241
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,100
Right here.

242
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,260
Alright, everyone stay still.

243
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,300
Like this? Is this good?

244
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,340
Come on.

245
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,100
Stop it.

246
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,100
Hey, what are you doing?

247
00:16:59,340 --> 00:16:59,820
Nothing.

248
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,220
Then why did you come out here?

249
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,161
Just came out to get some fresh air.

250
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh.

251
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,740
Is something wrong with you?

252
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,740
I've noticed for a while now.

253
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,420
No,

254
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,140
I just feel strange.

255
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,380
Strange how?

256
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,740
Well, as we grow up,

257
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,220
It feels like we are forced
to follow our dreams.

258
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,140
What do you mean?

259
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,220
Look at you,

260
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,100
you know what you want to do,

261
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,460
What you want to be.

262
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,540
But I don't know myself.

263
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,860
I just want to live my life.

264
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,540
Can't I?

265
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,980
But it's nothing,

266
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,340
I'm just rambling.

267
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm here for you.

268
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,540
Yay, I won!!!

269
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,300
Woahhh!

270
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,820
I win! I win!

271
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,700
Why are you so lucky?

272
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,780
How did you fall for some one like Yo?

273
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,300
I have no clue.

274
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,180
Maybe because he seems stupid?

275
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,820
It's true.

276
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,580
It's true?

277
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,300
Yep.

278
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,340
Here he comes.

279
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,940
Hey, do you want to go home?
Do you still want me to drop you off?

280
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,340
I have to go and play P' Yu's new game.

281
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,340
If you're in a hurry to go play games

282
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,940
then drop me off at the bus stop.

283
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,020
See you.

284
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,060
See you.

285
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,940
Happy Birthday.

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,500
Thanks!

287
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
See you.

288
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,900
Let's go.

289
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,821
Are you sure you want to go home ny
yourself at this hour?

290
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,860
It's late, do you want me to
drop you off at your place?

291
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,300
It's okay.

292
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,020
That day, I went home at this time

293
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
and there were still buses.

294
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,900
You know that the buses
around here aren't reliable.

295
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Come here and sit on bike.

296
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,940
No girl has ever sat on this!

297
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,260
You know? You're the
first person I let sit on this.

298
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,940
Are you going?

299
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,740
No thanks.

300
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I don't want to be like
the girls you're seeing.

301
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
You can go, I can go home myself.

302
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,860
Then I'm going.

303
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,340
Well, I told you already, right?

304
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,180
If I didn't come back.

305
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,060
What would you do?

306
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,740
Well, I didn't want to disturb you.

307
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,820
There are no buses at this hour.

308
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,940
I already know.

309
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,075
And the bus you got that
day was just pure luck.

310
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:55,711
Come here, come quickly.

311
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,140
If you don't want to disturb me,

312
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,340
I can be a rider for you today.

313
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,780
Hi! I'm Rider Yo!

314
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,496
I'm ready to drop off you with all 32 parts
of your body!

315
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:11,223
But your heart might be missing.

316
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,860
You're pretty crazy.

317
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,740
Yeah.

318
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,620
Put on the helmet.

319
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
If you say it like that, I wouldn't have
accepted the ride in the first place.

320
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,300
I'd give you one star and report you.

321
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
Hold on tight.

322
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,020
I'll cook it for you...
You like it, right, dear?

323
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,780
What are you doing here?

324
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,900
You don't even know how to cook,
why are you in the kitchen?

325
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,700
Nosy.

326
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,060
You play games all day and stay at home.

327
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,478
Go out and meet people sometimes.

328
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,420
Now, come help me chop the vegetables.

329
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,740
Ai, wait for me.

330
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,900
P' Yu!!

331
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,460
(So why are you here?)

332
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
(Don't you also don't know how to cook?)

333
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,140
(Ai)

334
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,980
(P' Yu, hey)

335
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
What should we cook?

336
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,875
Clear soup. I'm going to
stir-fry some vegetables.

337
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Oh, soup. Do you want to eat soup?
Stir-fried vegetables are fine too.

338
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,620
Sounds good.

339
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,460
What are you doing here?

340
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,100
You don't even know how to cook,
why are you in the kitchen?

341
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,340
Nosy.

342
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,780
Don't you also not know how to cook?

343
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,700
Why are you here?

344
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,380
Nosy.

345
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,300
You two are bickering early in the morning.

346
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,060
By the way, I need to
go to the plant market.

347
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,340
Dad Mhok asked me to buy some more plants
for the garden.

348
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:05,558
Wanna come?

349
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,940
No.

350
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,020
No way.

351
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,500
You have to go help him.

352
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,460
This is our garden, dear.

353
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,020
You spend all day playing games
and staying indoors.

354
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,780
Go out and meet people sometimes.

355
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,540
(Now, come help me chop the vegetables.)

356
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
Do you understand what I'm saying?

357
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,740
Oh my, that's clear.

358
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,020
Come on, come and help him.

359
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,140
Did you stay up late last night?

360
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,180
Are you listening to me? Come on, hurry.

361
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,060
Yes, Mom.

362
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,940
I'll go collect the laundry first.

363
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,340
Yes, Mom.

364
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
I'll cut the vegetables, you go wash them.

365
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,100
What are you staring at?

366
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,860
Is there something on my face?

367
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,820
P' Yu.

368
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,300
Ouch!

369
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
P' Yu, I'm sorry.

370
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,220
I didn't mean to.

371
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,980
It's okay.

372
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,340
Oh, wait a sec.

373
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,140
Hello?

374
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,300
Oh, yes. I'll check it for you.

375
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,580
Alright, thank you. Goodbye.

376
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,380
You're unusually kind today.

377
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,180
Isn't this normal?

378
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,540
People should take
responsibility for what they do.

379
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,700
Not everyone is like you.

380
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,620
Ouch!

381
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,740
Look, such a small cut and you act like
I cut my whole hand.

382
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,900
Ouch!

383
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,220
Why did you press it?

384
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,860
My little prank is nothing
compared to yours.

385
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,020
P' Yu, you should
practice your kitchen skills.

386
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,820
Getting startled and cutting
your finger, unbelievable.

387
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,980
Why practice? I usually eat
Mom Aoi's cooking anyway.

388
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,180
This is too much.

389
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,660
I think my mom takes better care of you
than her own son.

390
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,060
Are you sad?

391
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,180
Give me your finger.

392
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,740
Stop.

393
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,780
Ow.

394
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,260
I'll really press on it.

395
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,580
Don't, it already hurts.

396
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,820
Feed me some.

397
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,060
No.

398
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
Do you want me to let go of the wheel?

399
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,380
One.

400
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,340
Two.

401
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,900
Ah!

402
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:01,980
Open your mouth.

403
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,820
Just drive quietly.

404
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,980
And what's up with you?

405
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,380
You've been spaced out since this morning.

406
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,340
Uh, nothing.

407
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,500
I'm probably just tired.

408
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,340
I guess I stayed up too late
playing games last night.

409
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,100
Then why don't you take a nap?

410
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,300
I'll wake you up when we get there.

411
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
Ai, wait for me.

412
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,100
P' Yu!!

413
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,580
Hey!!

414
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,260
Ai!

415
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,220
What's wrong?

416
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
Why are you sweating so much?

417
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Are you feeling unwell?

418
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,980
Let me check.

419
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,780
It's nothing,

420
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:23,412
I just had a bad dream.

421
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,340
Are you sure you're okay?

422
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,700
Alright.

423
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,900
Here it is.

424
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,460
Which one do you want?

425
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,260
I think...

426
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,060
Hey!

427
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,020
Stop messing around!

428
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,940
You want to touch it?

429
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,180
But this one has a flower too.

430
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Really? Maybe it's this one.

431
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Hey, Ai, look at this.

432
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,267
Watch the road while you walk.

433
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,420
Aren't they looking to
see if we're crossing?

434
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,020
You're the one who
wasn't watching the road.

435
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,740
Let's go look at the plants.

436
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,700
There are many types here.

437
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,820
This one has red flowers,
which are prettier than the orange ones.

438
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,540
Welcome, this is my shop.

439
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,020
Hello, I'll take this one.

440
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,740
I think that one is better.
Let's go look over there.

441
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
P' Yu, when will you be done?

442
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,100
Just one last shop.

443
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Last shop, last shop, you
said that so many times.

444
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,780
You complain so much.

445
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,580
A million?!

446
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,485
It's a million already.

447
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,980
Ahem, young one.

448
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,820
What are you doing?

449
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:39,468
Do you know the special
feature of my mustache?

450
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,900
Do you see the white hairs on my mustache?

451
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,778
They are called trichomes,
or white hairs that are called...

452
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:49,620
not called or white hairs
that are silver in color.

453
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,460
My mustache can also trap dust in the air.

454
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,300
Isn't that cool?

455
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,020
It's in my mouth.

456
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm going now.

457
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,540
Just pick some plants out quickly.

458
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,540
I was going to braid them.

459
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,900
P'Yu, Are you done?

460
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,700
Let's go home.

461
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,420
Wait a minute, the atmosphere here is nice.

462
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,100
Why don't we stay a bit longer?

463
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,100
Usually, I like to come here to work.

464
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,260
Come on, hurry up.

465
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,700
Welcome.

466
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,340
Hey, Ai, come look at this.

467
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,620
A caterpillar.

468
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,300
Do you remember? We used to
raise them together when we were kids.

469
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
But when it turned into
a butterfly and flew away,

470
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
you ended up crying.

471
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:30,675
Tell the little caterpillar
what's wrong today.

472
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Why are you frowning all day?

473
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,700
Quickly.

474
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,020
Don't you feel any better?

475
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,140
No.

476
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,540
Stop messing around and let's go home.

477
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:01,707
And what if...

478
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,540
it's this one?

479
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,060
Shit!

480
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Oh! Ai!

481
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Ai, I'm so sorry.

482
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,340
Why did you do that?

483
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,860
I just wanted to surprise you.

484
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:23,403
Do you have a problem with me or something?

486
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,620
Why don't you ever stop?

487
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,460
We've talked about this before,
I don't like being teased.

488
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,620
I told you I don't like it.

489
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,420
It's just that I saw you looking down,

490
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,540
So I wanted to do something
to make you feel better.

491
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,060
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,500
Do you think doing this
will make me feel better?

493
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
Do you ever care about
other people's feelings?

494
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,820
Do you find it fun?

495
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,180
If you're having fun,

496
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,380
then good for you.

497
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,620
But I'm not having fun.

498
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,900
That's not what I meant.

499
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,140
Hey, hey, Ai, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

500
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,060
Ai.

501
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
(Ai, wait for me.)

502
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,260
(P' Yu.)

503
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,275
Ai, Ai.

504
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,100
P' Yu.

505
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,020
Ai, Ai, thank you so much.

506
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,020
For helping me today.

507
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,780
Are you hurt anywhere?

508
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,340
I'm fine. I'm not hurt.

509
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Ai, I'm sorry.

510
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,460
I know...

511
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,740
I've been teasing you since we were kids,

512
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,540
But I never had any bad intentions.

513
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
I just wanted to play with you.

514
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,940
But I didn't know it would
make you feel this bad.

515
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,460
Like today, I just wanted
to make you happier.

516
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,540
But I really didn't know how to do it.

517
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm sorry, Ai.

518
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Today, you got hurt because of me again.

519
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:41,492
I won't ask you to forgive me.

520
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,580
But...

521
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,580
I will try to improve myself.

522
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,140
I know you didn't mean any harm.

523
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,100
But sometimes...

524
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,900
I just don't understand your thinking.

525
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,180
We're grown up now,

526
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,900
there's so much more to do.

527
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,260
Stop teasing me already.

528
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,020
I promise, Ai,

529
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,300
I won't tease you anymore.

530
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
Because I don't want to be someone you...

531
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,100
dislike.

532
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,460
I'm sorry for saying bad things earlier.

533
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,980
I didn't mean it.

534
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,020
So,

535
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,100
do you like me a little bit more now?

536
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,660
I still don't like you,

537
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,540
But just a bit less.

538
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,780
So when I said I'd tease you less,

539
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
can I lower it down just a bit?

540
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,540
I'm not teasing you!

541
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,460
This is me being loving.

542
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,140
I can definitely stop teasing you.

543
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,580
It's true.

544
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,860
Um.

545
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,740
You're worried about other people.

546
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,980
But you're also hurt.

547
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,500
It hurts.

548
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,980
Take care of yourself.

549
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,500
It hurts.
Let's go home.

550
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,340
Come on.

551
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,020
It's not locked, you can come in.

552
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
You still sleep without locking your room
like when you were a kid.

553
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,940
Why are you here?

554
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
What's going on? I'm about to sleep.

555
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,260
Oh, I haven't given you
a birthday present yet.

556
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,300
This is a birthday present from me.

557
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,180
I'll open it now.

558
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,140
Sure.

559
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,500
You don't have to take
that picture if you don't like it.

560
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,460
I'm scared that it might
be a bad memory for you.

561
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,820
I'm taking it, it's cute.

562
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,260
I hope you're happy.

563
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,300
I'm going to go now,

564
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,540
I hope you have good dreams.

565
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,272
So you don't make that sour face.

566
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,540
P' Yu, I thought you weren't going to
tease me anymore.

567
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,260
I'm not teasing you, I'm just kidding.

568
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
Ah, I'm sorry.

569
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,660
Go, I'm going to sleep now.

570
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,900
I'm going to go now.

571
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,100
Um.

572
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,260
Goodnight.

573
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,780
P' Yu.

574
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,020
Ai.

575
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,700
(Next Episode)

576
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,820
Are you ok?

577
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Are you saying...

578
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,580
that you dreamt about yourself
falling off the Christmas tree?

579
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,620
Did it happen?

580
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,140
Hey!!!

581
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,460
Maybe it's just a coincidence?

582
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,260
You will see.

583
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,940
It's going to happen today.

584
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,980
Can I have one cold cup of water, please?

585
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,540
What do you know about your dream?

586
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,580
Nothing.

587
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,500
What?

588
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,300
We have come this far,

589
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,020
don't you want to know?

590
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,220
Go all the way.

591
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,820
Excuse me.

592
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,220
Or you...

593
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,780
dream too?

594
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,260
And they happened?
