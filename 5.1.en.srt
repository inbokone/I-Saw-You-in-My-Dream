00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,920
This series is purely a work of fiction,

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,880
and is not related to any actual persons, places, organizations, or events.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,080
Good thing P' Yu didn’t actually think about committing suicide.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,720
From now it's only us,

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,160
can you promise me...

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,960
that you won't disappear like that again?

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,920
It’s weird, huh?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,560
Last time, you dreamed about P' Yu.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,240
This time, you also dreamed about P' Yu or...

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,720
Anyone could tell from this afternoon that you were worried about me.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,640
Yeah, I'm worried about you.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,280
Connected to dreams, huh?

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,440
Shit.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,400
P' Yu.

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Are you scared of the dark?

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,120
Come here.

17
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Ai.

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,360
Ahhhh.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Shit.

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,240
Don't come near me!

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,600
Ai!

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,560
Ai!

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Ai!
What's wrong?

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't come near me!

25
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,240
Ai?

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
Don't come near me!

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,640
Ai.

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,480
Ai.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
It's me.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,920
Calm down.

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Slowly breathe.

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Ai.

33
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Ai.

34
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong?

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
What's wrong?

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
What's wrong honey?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I heard the transformer explode.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
So, I rushed to find Ai first.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Alright, I'll call the electricity authority.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Yes, sir.

41
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
I’ve reported it to the electricity authority.

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
They'll probably send someone to check it out.

43
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
Mom and Dad, you can rest now.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
I'll stay with Ai.

45
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,880
Are you sure, son?

46
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,800
Come on, let's go to bed.

47
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,840
He'll be fine now,

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,920
and Yu is here too.

49
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Alright.

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,520
If anything happens,

51
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,240
just call for us.

52
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,280
Ok.

53
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
Don't worry, Mom.

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,840
Okay.

55
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
So, is Ai okay?

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,840
He's better now.

57
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,880
But tonight, I'll stay with Ai.

58
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Alright, I probably won't go home tonight.

59
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
I'll sleep in Ing's room.

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,880
That's settled then.

61
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,600
Wait a second.

62
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Who gave you permission to sleep in my room?

63
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,080
I gave myself permission.

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,720
No.

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
Please, please, please.

66
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I know you've always been kind to me.

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,920
Just let me sleep here tonight.

68
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,240
Please, please, please.

69
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,920
Please.

70
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,560
Fine,

71
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,240
you can stay.

72
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,160
I pity you.

73
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,440
Thank you, Ing. You're the best.

74
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,160
By the way, what was wrong with Ai earlier?

75
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,320
His house lost power.

76
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,680
So, it must've been tough for him.

77
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
Is he okay?

78
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,640
I don't think anything's wrong.

79
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,960
I heard P' Yu will stay with him tonight.

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,000
I see.

81
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,840
But...

82
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
why is Ai so afraid of the dark?

83
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,320
I've never asked him.

84
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,000
So...

85
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,800
Mom.

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
Mom.

87
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
I'm stuck in the toilet.

88
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Mom!

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,280
Ai.

90
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,040
Mom!

91
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Ai.

92
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,360
Why won't you open the door?

93
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Help me!

94
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,960
Ai.

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
Why won't you open the door?

96
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,720
Open the door.

97
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,320
Mom!

98
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
Ai, Just open the door.

99
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Ai.

100
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Ai.

101
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Ai.

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm here darling.

103
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
Ai.

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,040
Mom!

105
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
What's wrong?

106
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,600
Mom!

107
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Dad, get the keys.

108
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,760
Don't be scared.

109
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
Ok, step aside.

110
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,480
Quickly.

111
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh, it's ok honey.

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Mom.

113
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Don't be scared.

114
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
You don't have to be scared.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
Walk slowly, slowly.

116
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
Walk slowly, slowly.

117
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Dad's here now.

118
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,640
Shh, it's okay.

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,000
Mom.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,880
Don't be scared, Mommy's right here.

121
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,480
That's my brave one, it's all right now.

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Ai.

123
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,760
Since then, P' Yu has always felt guilty,

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
feeling responsible for making Ai afraid of the dark.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
Wow.

127
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
P' Yu is really warm-hearted, huh?

128
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,560
Wait, how did you end up complimenting P' Yu?

129
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,560
Wasn't it P' Yu who made Ai like this?

130
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,200
But P' Yu is taking responsibility for Ai's feelings.

131
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,000
Unlike...

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,760
What? What? Go ahead and say it.

133
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
Nothing.

134
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm just going to continue finding a movie to watch.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,720
Hey, speak up.

136
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,320
Hey.

137
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,720
Aren't you tired of watching Dreamland all the time?

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,560
No, I like it.

139
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,800
Why do you like it so much?

140
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,640
The script is amazing, talking about pursuing dreams and all.

141
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
Plus, it's a musical. I love it.

142
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Do you want to watch it?

143
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
If not, just go home.

144
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,360
Alright, I'll watch it.

145
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,680
Whatever you say, Ing.

146
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
If you're sleeping in my room, you have to follow my rules.

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,040
Ouch.

148
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,600
Hey, let me sleep a bit.

149
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,440
If you're going to sleep, do it properly. My arm hurts.

150
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Your arm is soft.

151
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
It's all over your face.

152
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
Here, let me wipe it for you.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
So messy, like a kid.

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
No.

155
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,240
Wanna fight?

156
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,400
No.

157
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
No.

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,640
P' Yu, no.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,600
Wanna fight?

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,720
No.

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,160
P' Yu.

162
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,520
(Professor Mano)

163
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,840
Hello?

164
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Yes, Professor.

165
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
I'll head over right away.

166
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,160
Are you in the bathroom?

167
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes, I'm in the bathroom.

168
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
I need to pee, can I go in?

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
Go to your own house.

170
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,160
I can't wait anymore.

171
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Please let me go in.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,320
No.

173
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,680
Ai, please let me go in.

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,400
No.

175
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,320
No.

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
Please let me go in.

177
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,960
No.

178
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Can I go in?

179
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,320
No.

180
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Please let me go in.

181
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Ouch.

182
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
Sorry, sorry.

183
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm really sorry.

184
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,880
You're so messy, like a kid.

185
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
See?

186
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,760
You're so messy, like a kid.

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
No.

188
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,760
What are you doing, P' Yu?

189
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
I can do it myself.

190
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
Let me wipe it a bit first.

191
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
No.

192
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
Wanna fight?

193
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
P' Yu.

194
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,560
Come on, let me wipe it one more time.

195
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,120
No.

196
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,920
Just a bit.

197
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
No.

198
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
P' Yu. No.

199
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,000
No.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,160
Why haven't you submitted your major selection form yet?

201
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,720
Hmm?

202
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,520
Well...

203
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
I haven't decided on a major yet.

204
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,800
And by the time I realized, the deadline had already passed.

205
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
But if you don't submit it,

206
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
you won't be able to enroll in your major courses.

207
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,800
Next year, you might have to take a break from studying.

208
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm sorry, professor.

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
I'll give you one more day.

210
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,920
Tomorrow, bring the major selection form...

211
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,880
along with your proposal before 8 AM.

212
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you think you can make it?

213
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,640
I can.

214
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,440
Thank you, professor.

215
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,640
But you will have to present your proposal to the committee yourself.

216
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,680
Otherwise, you'll have to drop from the major.

217
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
Understood.

218
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Thank you.

219
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,600
(Major Selection Form)

220
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,560
Ai.

221
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,520
Ai.

222
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,560
Ai.

223
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
Ouch.

224
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I just asked what you're going to do next.

225
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know either.

226
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,400
There's a lot on my mind lately.

227
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Both about choosing a major and about P’...

228
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Is it about the dreams?

229
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Oh, calm down.

230
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
Think it over.

231
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,720
So,

232
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
about the film major you wanted to pursue earlier,

233
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,280
Don’t you want it anymore?

234
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,160
I’m not sure.

235
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,560
I’m uncertain now.

236
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,440
Previously, I wanted to go into engineering,

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,480
But at the last moment, I decided to switch to Communication Arts,

238
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,640
To follow Yo.

239
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Now I don’t know what to do.

240
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,280
Um, let me ask you, Ing.

241
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah?

242
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,680
Why did you choose the film major?

243
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,080
Because I like it, you know that.

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
Yeah.

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
But the future is uncertain, right?

246
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,160
Will you really be able to make it a career?

247
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Even if you do, the pay might be low.

248
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah,

249
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,400
that’s true.

250
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Even knowing this, you still want to study it?

251
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,200
I just like it,

252
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,400
I just know that I want to do this.

253
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,400
I want to learn and understand it more.

254
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,080
But who knows what the future holds?

255
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,200
I might not get to work in this field.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
But at least I'm happy to study it.

257
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,400
I want to know what I want and be so sure like you.

258
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,240
It's fine.

259
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,320
I think we practiced too little.

260
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,160
Yeah.

261
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,040
I couldn’t hit it at all.

262
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,360
Maybe studying is the only thing

263
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I’m confident about.

264
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,160
Hey, don’t look over there.

265
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,280
They’ll think we’re gossiping about them.

266
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
You’re gossiping, I’m not.

267
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,520
Damn, P’ Yu, you scared me.

268
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
What are you doing here?

269
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,680
I saw Ai walking ahead,

270
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,360
So I followed him.

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
But what about you, Ai? What are you doing here?

272
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,000
I was just walking around aimlessly and ended up here.

273
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
Mind if I sit down?

274
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,040
Are you okay?

275
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
I’m stressed about choosing a major.

276
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,560
Yo doesn’t seem to stress about things like this.

277
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,960
Well, he knew what major he wanted to choose since he entered the comm arts program.

278
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
And what do you want to study, Ai?

279
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
I have no idea.

280
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,320
I don’t know what I’m good at.

281
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,720
I don’t know what I want to do.

282
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,880
I don't have dreams like others.

283
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,320
And when it comes time to choose,

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
it feels like being forced to have a dream,

285
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,000
to have something you want to do.

286
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,440
Exactly.

287
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

288
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,080
If I were to give you advice right now,

289
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,000
I’d say, Ai, what are you interested in.

290
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,920
Just choose to study that.

291
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
People don’t have to be good at everything.

292
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,080
Look at me, I’m dumb about a lot of things.

293
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,160
I agree with that.

294
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,360
Because we’re not good,

295
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
because we don’t know,

296
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
if we already knew, why would we spend money and time to learn it?

297
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,560
Right?

298
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,360
Another thing is, not having a dream

299
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,920
there's notthing wrong with that.

300
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,280
Keep studying and keep finding it.

301
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
But I don’t know if what I choose will be okay.

302
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
It’s like being afraid of the dark.

303
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,000
What do you mean?

304
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,360
Because you don’t know what’s ahead of you.

305
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
You don’t know what’s waiting for you.

306
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,360
You can’t see it at all, right?

307
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,840
I just want to tell you that

308
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Ai, you don't need to worry so much about the future.

309
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Nobody knows what the future holds for us.

310
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Choosing what to study isn't the end.

311
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
It can't completely determine our future.

312
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,160
But to me, Ai, you're already very capable.

313
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,880
I don't know what others think,

314
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
or how you see yourself,

315
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,800
but I think you should stop looking for a dream,

316
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,200
stop looking down a path you can't see.

317
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Try looking at yourself instead.

318
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,080
I think you might discover something special about yourself.

319
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,160
You're quite warm-hearted, you know.

320
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,360
P' Yu,

321
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,240
thank you...

322
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
for all the advice,

323
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
and...

324
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
for being with me when the power went out.

325
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,400
I know why you stay with me every time the power goes out.

326
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,200
I've wanted to talk to you about this many times,

327
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,360
but there was never the right moment.

328
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
I want to tell you that...

329
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,360
my fear of the dark,

330
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,040
it's not because of you.

331
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Actually, I was already afraid of the dark before that.

332
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,120
Hey, let's go play outside, shall we?

333
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Come on, quickly.

334
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,560
Mom!

335
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
Mom!

336
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm in here.

337
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Mom!

338
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,440
Mom!

339
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,360
Mom!
