1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,360
So what made you decide to take me out to eat?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Didn't you say you were bored at home?

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,760
Just trying to cheer you up.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,400
What did you order?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm here, my dear friend!

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,160
Did that hurt?

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,280
Sorry, sorry.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,320
I forgot.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Why are you all late?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,000
Sit down.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Blame this popular guy.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,240
Takes forever to greet everyone and get in the car.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,280
Let's eat, I'm starving.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
This is so delicious.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,680
Wipe it for me.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,720
Be careful of your wound.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Nachos, right?

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,080
Have you eaten here before?

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,280
It's my family's favorite place.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
Don't move too much, or you'll hurt your wound.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
What do you want?

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
Shrimp.

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,160
Sure.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,920
Ok.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
Do you want anything else? Squid?

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,800
The biggest one.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,400
Tell me if you want anything.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,880
I'll get it for you.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,840
Okay?

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
It's not even dark yet.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,680
After we finish eating,

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
are we going to watch something at home?

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Ink, you're not in a hurry to go back, right?

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Uh...

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,280
No, I'm not in a hurry.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
There's a new series out today.

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,280
Want to watch it together?

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,880
Sounds good.

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's do it.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Hey,

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Whoa!

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,040
Whose is this?

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,640
Mine.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,520
Hello?

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh, you're already at the front of the house?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
I'll come out to get you.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,040
Hey everyone, this is Peach.

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,560
He just dropped by to surprise me.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,920
So I invited her to watch the movie with us.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,280
Come on! The more people, the more fun.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,080
Sure.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
Let's keep watching.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Are you okay?

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
Um.

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,200
P' Yu!

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
You almost gave me a heart attack.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,320
Sorry, it's my phone.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,600
I need to take this call for a bit.

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Sorry, sorry.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,160
Where are you going?

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Just a quick work call.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,680
I'll be right back.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,520
Just a moment.

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,680
Hello?

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Yes, Goodbye.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,120
Thank you.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Yes.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Who is it?

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,120
It's me, Ai.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,400
Come on in.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,360
So you’re hiding here.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Sorry,

74
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
a client called with an urgent job.

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
Hmm.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Aren't you watching the movie anymore?

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Nope.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,720
Why not?

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,320
What are you looking at?

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,640
Can't I look?

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,120
Hmm.

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
Do you want to stay with me?

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,000
Huh?

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
Are you afraid of ghosts?

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm not afraid.

86
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,800
You should go back to work.

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
Go on.

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,840
Boo!

89
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,440
You're lucky your condo is near Peach's.

90
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Otherwise, you'd still not be home by now.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Hey,

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,680
why did you turn off the car?

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,920
Didn't I tell you?

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,360
I have practice tomorrow.

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
Come practice with me.

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,800
No.

97
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,840
Don't act all sly to stay in my room,

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
and drag me to practice with you.

99
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,520
Come on, you usually go everywhere with me.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,560
I don't have class tomorrow,

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
and I don't want to go to campus.

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,600
Please, please, please.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
Ing, would you really abandon your friend Yo?

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,160
Come with me, and I'll treat you to a meal tomorrow.

105
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay?

106
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
Why don't you invite your young lover?

107
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Young lover...

108
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,520
Do you mean Peach?

109
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,840
He gets hot easily, and besides,

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,600
Peach and I are just like siblings.

111
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,520
Just like siblings.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
What kind of siblings are you?

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,320
Siblings who chat, get to know each other,

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,640
and understand each other.

115
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,120
Are you serious about this one?

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,480
Well...

117
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
we're just getting to know each other.

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,280
No need to rush into being serious, right?

119
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Are you okay?

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,240
No, I'm just tired.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
You can go now.

122
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
Wait.

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,640
What about me staying over at your place?

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,560
Hey!

125
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,280
What's with him?

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,880
Ok.

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,880
Hmm?

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Well?

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,120
It looks so much better.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
Do you want to try changing angles?

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,320
We just took horizontal photos, right?

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
Go ahead and take the shot.

133
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,800
P' Yu,

134
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,640
come teach me.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Sure.

136
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
It’s not...

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
It's not working at all.

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,720
What if we want a different color?

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Huh?

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
A different color?

141
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
This color, right?

142
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
One, two, three.

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you want to try shooting with a film camera?

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Do you have one?

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,680
Yeah, do you want to try?

146
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Sure.

147
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,520
Here, give it a try.

148
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,680
But you need to look through it.

149
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
Wanna try?

150
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,880
Let's switch.

151
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
One, two...

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
It's slightly to the left, it'll look nice.

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Here.

154
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Thanks.

155
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Are you tired today?

156
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,040
It was fun.

157
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
Wow, this is so much more fun than learning in the classroom.

158
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,400
When I was in class, I almost fell asleep.

159
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,120
Look,

160
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I can’t believe I took this photo.

161
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,040
I told you you could do it, see?

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,160
You have a good teacher.

163
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
So confident.

164
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course.

165
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
So, after we're done, where are you going next?

166
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,960
Might go home, I guess.

167
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay.

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,080
Where are you going, P' Yu?

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,920
I’m planning to go develop the film.

170
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,600
Develop the film?

171
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,960
Can I come along?

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,280
The darkroom is really dark.

173
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,240
If you’re there, it’s okay with me.

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,320
I didn’t mean it like that.

175
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
I mean, if someone is with me, it’s fine.

176
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
It’s probably not that dark, right?

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,880
Close the door.

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,440
Come on.

179
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
You can open your eyes now.

180
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,840
Whoa.

181
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Can you handle it?

182
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,040
I can.

183
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
If not, then...

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,640
you can hold onto my hand

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,720
or not.

186
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,880
Do you want to try developing the film yourself?

187
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,480
I want to,

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,880
but I’m afraid I might ruin your photos.

189
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,160
You won’t ruin them.

190
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,680
It’s really easy. Give it a try.

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,760
This tray is called a fixer, or the stabilizer solution.

192
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
You take the photo from this tray

193
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
and rinse it in the tray with plain water.

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,440
Give it a try.

195
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,320
Is it clean?

196
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,120
It’s clean, now you can hang it up to dry.

197
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Here.

198
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,040
Hang it up to dry.

199
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, right.

200
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I haven’t asked you yet,

201
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,520
why did you take me to the church?

202
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,720
I thought you would take me to a more beautiful place.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
At first, I had several places in mind.

204
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,120
But...

205
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,360
the assignment was to find a place that represents us the most.

206
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,920
Um.

207
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
So I thought,

208
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,240
if there’s a place that represents me the most,

209
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
it would be here.

210
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
That makes sense.

211
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,360
What do you think?

212
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,160
You’ve got the brains of the family.

213
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,920
Are you ok?

214
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
When you asked me to help,

215
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,840
I didn't expect to have to carry so much stuff.

216
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,920
And you woke me up so early.

217
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
Give it here, I'll carry it myself.

218
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
It's okay.

219
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm just complaining for the sake of it.

220
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
Hmm.

221
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,320
You said it yourself.

222
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,400
Just a moment, please.

223
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Yu,

224
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,640
what are you doing here?

225
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,160
I have a photo shoot here.

226
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,720
Oh, Panpan!

227
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,040
You look so beautiful in that outfit today,
did you know that?

228
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,720
Thank you.

229
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,200
Oh, Ice, this is Yu.

230
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,120
He's a...

231
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
a photographer who has taken photos for me before.

232
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,600
Nice to meet you.

233
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm Ice.

234
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,960
Nice to meet you. I'm Yu.

235
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,400
Sorry, excuse me.

236
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
Can I take some behind-the-scenes shots, please?

237
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
Sure, of course.

238
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,360
Right over here.

239
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,960
How do you feel about today's promotional photoshoot?

240
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Well, it's our first day appearing on a show together.

241
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,160
Frankly, I just want to say that Panpan is very cute.

242
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,160
Being with her makes me happy.

243
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,120
We are the newest and hottest couple.

244
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
So please follow and support us.

245
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,120
Yes, we both prepared very well for today.

246
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,040
We hope that the photoshoot today will come out,

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,920
will come out beautiful and cute for everyone to see.

248
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,600
Please follow and support us.

249
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Yes, please follow and support us.

250
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,600
Let's start. Ready?

251
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Ready? One, two, three.

252
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,480
Great.

253
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,800
Keep posing.

254
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,680
Good.

255
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,080
Now, try leaning on the shoulder.

256
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,560
One, two.

257
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,800
Great, great.

258
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,320
One, two.

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,440
Keep going.

260
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,480
You're doing great.

261
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,600
Come on.

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,360
One, two.

263
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,040
One, two.

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Thanks a lot for helping me out today.

265
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,560
P' Yu,

266
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
are you okay these days?

267
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,120
And if I say I'm okay,

268
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,040
you'll know I'm lying, right?

269
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,840
If you're not okay,

270
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
If you're not okay,

271
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
you don't have to pretend to be fine.

272
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Even though I might not be able to help much,

273
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
but I'm a good listener.

274
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,960
Hmm.

275
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
You're growing up and acting so mature now.

276
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,400
You know how to say things like this.

277
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,760
Oh, P' Yu!

278
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
If you're not okay,

279
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,040
let me know.

280
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,120
Hmm.

281
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,600
Hey, P' Yu,

282
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
want to go for some grilled pork tomorrow?

283
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,560
Huh?

284
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,680
What's with the sudden mood?

285
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I just want to eat it.

286
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,800
I'll pay for the meal.

287
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,880
Wow, what’s with you today?

288
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
Are you going or not?

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
Of course,

290
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
if you invite me like this, I have to go.

291
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
But why are you being so nice to me today?

292
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
You were so quick with your answer!

293
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
So, I'll see you tomorrow, P' Yu.

294
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
Yes, see you tomorrow.

295
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,760
Yes!

296
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
Thank you.

297
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,040
Ah!

298
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,080
Hey! Hey!

299
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,640
Oh, sorry about that.

300
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,880
You can get a new piece.

301
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,520
Ouch!

302
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
It's not cooked yet.

303
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,960
Oops!

304
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,640
Oops!

305
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,440
Yo!

306
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
Hey, it's edible!

307
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,760
No, it's not, Yo.

308
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,800
Hey, Yo, there's more here.

309
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,280
Excuse me, excuse me.

310
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,640
Excuse me, we've arrived.

311
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,760
We've arrived.

312
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
Sorry about that. Here you go.

313
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Sure.

314
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
What's wrong?

315
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,600
Yo? Tell me what happened.

316
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,320
Yo!

317
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,440
P' Yu probably won't be coming back tonight.

318
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,400
What do you mean?

319
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
(Please apologize to Ai for me, I couldn't keep my promise.)

320
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,520
P' Yu.

321
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,400
Let's go find P' Yu.

322
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,320
You don't have to.

323
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,480
When he thinks too much, he's like this.

324
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,440
But this time it wasn't like before.

325
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Hey, Here it is, I found it.

326
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,480
It's here!

327
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,840
How do you know it's here?

328
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
If P' Yu isn't here, I don't even know where he will be.

329
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,840
Don't have seen him.

330
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
What should we do?

331
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,760
P' Yu!

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,200
Ai! Where are you going?

333
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
P' Yu!

334
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
P' Yu!!
