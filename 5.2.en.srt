1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,320
Mom!

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,600
Mom!

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,120
Ai!

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,360
Ai!

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,120
Help me, Mom!

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,760
Ai, Mom is here, sweetie.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,080
Mom is here, sweetie.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
Don't be scared, Mom is here.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,240
Mom is here.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,120
Mom!

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,920
Don't be scared.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,360
Mom.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,400
Mom is here now, sweetie.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,560
It's okay, don't be scared, sweetie.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Don't be scared, sweetie.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,560
Don't cry.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's go.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,760
Don't be scared, sweetie.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Mom is here.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,280
Don't cry.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,880
I never knew that.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,600
How could you?

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,560
I never told you.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,280
What?

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Don't touch me.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,240
Can my dreams just help me choose my major?

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,640
(I think you should stop looking for a dream.)

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
(Stop looking down a path you can't see.)

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
(Try looking at yourself instead.)

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,840
(I think you might discover something special about yourself.)

31
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,680
Shit.

32
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
Ai, take a sandwich with you, sweetie.

33
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm going now, Mom, I don't have time.

34
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh.

35
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,160
Ai, I'll give you a ride.

36
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
Hey, what time is it?

37
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
It's almost presentation time.

38
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
Try calling him.

39
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Uh.

40
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Let's go, Ai.

41
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,040
What is it?

42
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Here, take this for the fare. Hurry up.

43
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm leaving now.

44
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
Bye-bye, I'm off.

45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Bye-bye.

46
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,320
Wait for me, please!

47
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
He's not answering.

48
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,360
What's going on?

49
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,920
Here he is!

50
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
Finally, you're late.

51
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
The professor is looking for you, go on in.

52
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,200
Okay.

53
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
Quickly.

54
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Hello, I'm Ai Ashira Akethananrakul.

55
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Today, I will present my project titled

56
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,520
I Saw You in My Dream: You, Me, Dreams, Us.

57
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
Now, let me talk about the logline.

58
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
The logline of this story is

59
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,520
Boss is a Communication Arts student

60
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,760
and he starts to have weird dreams.

61
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,960
How was it?

62
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
It was fine... I guess.

63
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,960
I thought you were going to be late.

64
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,160
It's a good thing my brother dropped you off.

65
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,960
That's the sandwich I gave P' Yu this morning.

66
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Yeah.

67
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,320
P'Yu came to cheer you on during your presentation,

68
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
but he had to go back to work.

69
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,720
Really?

70
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,520
Yeah, he asked me to give you this.

71
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,760
He said you haven't eaten anything since this morning.

72
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,800
What do you think?

73
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,640
I think it's okay.

74
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,120
Alright then.

75
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
Okay, let's set up the scene.

76
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Excuse me, are you P' Yu?

77
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,560
Oh, yes.

78
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
Someone left something for you.

79
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,680
Who?

80
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
A customer wanted to give it to you.

81
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
Oh, okay. Thank you.

82
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,920
(Kiddo: Sent your favorite mango sticky rice, eat it!!)

83
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Wow,

84
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,280
it's really crowded.

85
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Where should we sit?

86
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,960
How about over there?

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,680
Where?

88
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Over there, there's a fan too.

89
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,840
Look so delicious.

90
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,560
Hey!!

91
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,440
Hey!!

92
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,920
This is my senior from the badminton club, P' Wann.

93
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
Looks like we're running into each other again, huh?

94
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,440
You're...

95
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,000
Ai.

96
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
He's my childhood friend.

97
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
You've met before.

98
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,040
Hello.

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Do you want anything special to eat?

100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,640
I'll buy it for you as a thank you for helping me earlier.

101
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
Oh, it's okay.

102
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,840
I'll go have a look myself.

103
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,120
No, really, I want to buy it for you.

104
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Alright, anything is fine then.

105
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,920
Okay, I'll choose something for you.

106
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,480
Sure.

107
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Wow, P' Wann, you didn't even offer to buy me anything.

108
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Well, if you want something, just buy it yourself.

109
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
Double standards!

110
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Alright, follow me, let's go pick something out. My treat.

111
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Thanks.

112
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,840
I think P' Wann is interested in you.

113
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,600
What are you talking about?

114
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
I think he just felt sorry for me earlier.

115
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I remember from that day,

116
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
he intentionally hit the shuttlecock at your head

117
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,440
maybe because he wanted to talk to you.

118
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
You're exaggerating.

119
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
If it had been a golf ball instead, my head would have been dented.

120
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
You deserve to be hit by a golf ball.

121
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,640
Hey,  Last night while I was researching for the project,

122
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I found some scary footage,

123
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
it was exactly the same as my story.

124
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
Let me show you.

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,560
(Well, the story that my grandma told me)

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,160
(is that my grandpa used to dream about the future.)

127
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
(I never believed it until one day)

128
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,720
(my grandpa was caught in a gas explosion.)

129
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,240
(And in the morning, he told my grandma that)

130
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,520
(he had dreamed about the incident.)

131
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,440
(Oh, that’s exciting!)

132
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,560
(Yes, and now I’ve dreamed of someone I love being in danger.)

133
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,160
(What did you dream about?)

134
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,000
(I dreamt that…)

135
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,360
Whoa, what is this?

136
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,040
That’s it?

137
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
Yeah, that's the problem. I can't find the second tape.

138
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
You don't actually think this is real, do you?

139
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,520
Who knows?

140
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
I want to tell you that...

141
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,920
I want to find this woman.

142
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
There it is, I knew it.

143
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,320
Can you really trust it?

144
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,720
It's going to be like last time.

145
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
I know, but I think this is the only way

146
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
to understand my dreams.

147
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,080
But the clip is really old.

148
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
Where should we go to find her?

149
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,280
Or maybe you could try finding someone else?

150
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Here you go.

151
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,720
Minced pork basil with no chili and a runny fried egg.

152
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Your favorite.

153
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,800
Thank you.

154
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
Did you tell him that?

155
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,280
What were you guys talking about?

156
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,240
Oh, nothing special, just chatting.

157
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,200
Talking about wanting to go on a trip.

158
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Where to? I want to go too.

159
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,400
So, what’s the plan after this?

160
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,800
We don’t have any plans yet, P’ Wann.

161
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,920
How about we play badminton?

162
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Ai, would you like to join us?

163
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh, no thanks.

164
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,840
I’m tired and just want to go home and rest.

165
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,520
Let me give you a ride home.

166
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,400
Thanks for the ride.

167
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
My pleasure, Ai.

168
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,920
Have a safe trip home, P’ Wann.

169
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,560
Will do.

170
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,280
Hey,

171
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
can I get your contact information?

172
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
Sure.

173
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,000
Here you go.

174
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,880
I'll be in touch.

175
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,840
Sure.

176
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Good luck.

177
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,160
See you.

178
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,320
Wow, you’re quite the charmer, huh?

179
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
What the hell do you mean?

180
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,400
Let’s go, I'm going to go in my house.

181
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Can I get your contact?

182
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Can I get your contact?

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
Really, though.

184
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,840
You already have it, why are you asking?

185
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,840
Oh, just a senior from my badminton club.

186
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,400
Okay.

187
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,760
I bought some snacks for you, want to eat together?

188
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,000
You go ahead.

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,560
I'm trying to lose weight these days.

190
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
You? Trying to lose weight?

191
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,280
Seriously?

192
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,400
Do you remember the lowest weight you’ve been since you were born?

193
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,920
Right after I was born, I weighed two kilos.

194
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,760
Alright, I’m going to bed.

195
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,720
Fine.

196
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,640
Good night.

197
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,120
Would you like to eat together?

198
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm tired.

199
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,880
I woke up early for work today.

200
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I’ll go to bed now.

201
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,000
But I bought luk chup.

202
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,600
You want some?

203
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,000
Luk chup?

204
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,840
Fine, I'll have some so someone won't be sad.

205
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,040
Come on.

206
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,560
Here you go.

207
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
Thanks.

208
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,640
Be careful you might go broke if you're so nice to everyone.

209
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm not nice to everyone.

210
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,080
You can slowly eat it.

211
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,400
Why?

212
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,120
Why should I be nicer to other people than you?

213
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
What are you saying?

214
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,120
What? I haven't done anything yet?

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,280
Ai.

216
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,280
I want to go for a holiday somewhere.

217
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,840
Can you go with me?

218
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Please?

219
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,200
Uh.. Fine.

220
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Deal, pinky promise.

221
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,760
Fine.

222
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,080
Aren't you going to feed me some?

223
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,360
Feed me.

224
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,280
No.

225
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
I'm haven't had one piece yet.

226
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,720
No.

227
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
Come on, one piece.

228
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,240
No.

229
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
I bought it for you and I haven't had any yet.

230
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,560
Are you going on a trip?

231
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,400
Invite Ing to travel with us.

232
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,680
Rock, scissors, paper.

233
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,440
Yeah!

234
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
I want to go see the animals at the farm.

235
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,040
I want to ride a bicycle.

236
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,920
Wait for me.

237
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,720
Hey!

238
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,000
P' Yu.

239
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,120
Every time I help P' Yu.

240
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,960
I always get hurt instead.

241
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,640
Surprise!

242
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,920
P' Wann

243
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,000
Is that what friends do to each other?

244
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,840
Then don't you love me like I love you?

245
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,720
I'll feed you.

246
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,400
You don't have to worry about me that much.

247
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,120
How can I not be worried? You…
