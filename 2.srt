3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,320
(Previously)
Is something wrong with you?

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
I've noticed for a while now.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,200
I just feel strange.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,480
Well, as we grow up,

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,200
It feels like we are forced
to follow our dreams.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,000
Are you done?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Let's go home.

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,440
Wait a minute, the atmosphere here is nice.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,480
P' Yu!!

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,720
I'm sorry, Ai.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,840
I won't tease you anymore.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,480
Because I don't want to
be someone you dislike.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,280
This is a birthday present from me.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,840
I hope you're happy.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm going to go now,

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,680
I hope you have good dreams.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,720
Argh!!

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,760
Ai, what's wrong?

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,280
Mom!

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
What's wrong?

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,840
What are these noises in the morning?

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
I was cleaning the restroom and got scared.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,320
Ah...

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
I had a nightmare.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
Mom! It was really a nightmare.

28
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:53,923
Mom! Get out!

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,040
I am literally 20.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,440
You cannot just walk in.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,800
But still, you had a nightmare
and screamed so loud.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,560
So grown up.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
And hurry getting up,

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
or you will be late for class again.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,040
Take the food for P' Yu too.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
No!

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
You give it to him yourself.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Eh, you are about to go out, aren't you?

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,480
Just take it to him.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,400
- Hurry up.
- Mom!

41

"I Saw You in My Dream"
(Episode 2)

42
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
Ai!!

43
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,400
What happened?

44
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
Yu.

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,640
Hello.

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Hi! Now, this is perfect.

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,720
I was asking Ai to
bring this food to his dad.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
He forgot it.

49
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,120
Um.

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,480
Can you take him there?

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Mom, I'd be late for class.

52
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,299
For sure.

53
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,686
Thank you Yu.

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,240
See? Yu is such an good boy.

55
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Ai, Just a quick ride,

56
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,866
and P' Yu can drop you off too.

57
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,600
Just wait here,

58
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,680
he will come soon.

59
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,200
What's wrong?

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
Oh, Ai, Yu.

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,320
Hi!
Hi, hi.

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Thank you for bringing me lunch.

63
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,185
You're welcome.

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
Dad, thank me!

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
I'm the one who brought it here.

66
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,080
What? Yu was the one driving.

67
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,600
You just sat still, that
doesn't sound tiring.

68
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
Why would you say that?

69
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
I thank both of you,
Brought it all the way here.

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Got it. Now, time to
go to class and to work.

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
Right?
Yes.

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
And don't come home so late.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,560
There are lots of robbers around.

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,360
I know I know.

75
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm going now.

76
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,480
What's the matter with him?

77
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
I have no idea.

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,640
What happened?

79
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
No, nothing.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,160
You said you are no longer
mad that I pranked you.

81
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes.

82
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,520
This is... just normal for me.

83
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:00,771
Normal?

84
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,482
And you can look at me now?

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
Yes... of course.

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,840
Why can't I?

87
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
P' Yu, drive.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,880
Ah... and this evening
do you have any plans?

90
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
I was thinking...

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
I will sleep over in Ing's room.

92
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,733
We have homework.

93
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,640
Please, let me sleepover at yours.

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
You have your own home.

95
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
Why don't you just sleep at yours?

96
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,760
Ai.

97
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,560
Ai?

98
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,160
(Do you all understand?)

99
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,080
(Any questions?)

100
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,200
Ai!

101
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
No!

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Ah... Okay, if it was so unclear,

103
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,760
I can explain it again.

104
00:08:17,426 --> 00:08:20,207
Uh... No, professor.

105
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:21,338
It's fine.

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Sorry.

107
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,200
Okay.

108
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
What is wrong with you?

109
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
It's because... you won't let me sleepover.

110
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
Do you need to overreact that much?

111
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Okay, you can.

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
Thank you, bestie.

113
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,840
(And, that's it for today)

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,080
(Goodbye, everyone)

115
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,090
Yo.

116
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,080
Yo.

117
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:04,104
Yo!

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,200
What's wrong?

119
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:09,796
No, nothing's wrong.

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
I am totally fine.

121
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,120
Yes, absolutely totally fine.

122
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,320
See? Everyone is out already.

123
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,688
It's the girlfriend for sure.

124
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:25,162
What girlfriend? We were just talking.

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,440
See?

126
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Uh... after today's class...

127
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,240
do you guys want to go
to the volunteer club room?

128
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
This evening, I cannot.

129
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
I have a badminton club.

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,120
If not because of the scholarship,

131
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,600
I would not have to care
about all these clubs.

132
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,720
Ing is also a scholarship kid.

133
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:43,865
He doesn't have problems like you.

134
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Alright, Don't forget tomorrow,

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,840
we have a photoshoot
for the volunteer camp.

136
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
Wait, wait.

137
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,080
Hello?

138
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,520
Yes, I just finished class right now.

139
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,120
I'm going, bye.

140
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,960
See you.

141
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,387
What about you? Are you going?

142
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:23,607
Of course.

143
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
But, can I go to the library first?

144
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,051
I want to look for some information.

145
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,626
You? Going to the library?

146
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,280
Just tell me what is this about.

147
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,579
You have been acting
weird since before class.

148
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,040
What? No!

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm just looking for something.

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What thing?

151
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:12,590
Uh... I have an idea for a film.

152
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,252
Huh!

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
You? Want to make a film?

154
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,600
Have you decided to major in film?

155
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,346
Not sure yet.

156
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:22,516
Just an idea.

157
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,621
So, I am doing research.

158
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,040
Ah... and what is this
idea you are talking about?

159
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,400
So I can help you.

160
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
It's...

161
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Do you think it is possible that...

162
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
when we dream about
something, some event,

163
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,680
it happens in real life.

164
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:47,778
I don't know.

165
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Can it really happen?

166
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:52,562
Why do you care about it?

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,600
I...

168
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
I... just...

169
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
Okay, okay.

170
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,560
I'll just help research.

171
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,066
Interesting.

172
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,960
It can be the premise for a film.

173
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,840
Premise...

174
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,240
Do you get it?

175
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,160
Yes.

176
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,520
A film's premise right?

177
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,760
Interesting.

178
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,520
A dream is formed by the unconscious mind...

179
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
and also storage for desires.

180
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
Especially, sexual desires.

181
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
What is going on, Ai?

182
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Too loud! Keep it down!

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Sorry, sorry.

184
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,750
I'll help.

185
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:45,515
Fuck!

186
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
What are you doing?

187
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
In the dark too?

188
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
I was horrified.

189
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,680
What's wrong with you weirdo?

190
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:08,362
What?

191
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,920
Nothing.

192
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,880
Just go shower, you smell.

193
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Wanna smell me?

194
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Smell it, fresh sweat.

195
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,865
Ew, go shower now.

196
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:22,958
Sure?

197
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,235
Um.

198
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,600
Go.

199
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,560
(Due to the report, citizens claim to
have seen a man doing drugs in the area)

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
(A citizen told a journalist that)

201
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,400
(A person broke into his
house and stole things)

202
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
(sometimes, he would
steal from people walking by)

203
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,560
This is just around your home, Ai.

204
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
(Initially, we have
coordinated with the officers)

205
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
(And they have taken over)

206
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,280
Ai!

207
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,480
Ai!

208
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,320
Ai!!

209
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
What? I almost jumped!

210
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:08,316
I was focusing.

211
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,000
Focusing on what?

212
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
Let me see.

213
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,800
Just a little.

214
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,360
No.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,520
Are you still researching for information?

216
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,635
Aren't you too serious?

217
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
I don't think it's just about a film anymore.

218
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,320
Tell me. What is this about?

219
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,635
Do you remember Christmas Day?

220
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,796
Yeah, why?

221
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,453
The night before that,

222
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,402
I dreamed about the exact same thing.

223
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,080
Of me at the Christmas tree.

224
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
Are you saying...

225
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
that you dreamt about yourself
falling off the Christmas tree?

226
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,582
Did it happen?

227
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,920
So?

228
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:09,771
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

229
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,684
And it happened again!

230
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,480
(Ow!)

231
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,560
(Ow!)

232
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,061
(Ai!!)

233
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,040
(P' Yu.)

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,840
You are just overthinking.

235
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,280
Coincidence can't happen this many times.

236
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
You need more sleep.

237
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm not talking to you anymore.

238
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:35,915
You don't have to believe me.

239
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,840
Just wait and see.

240
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:40,067
What? Are you mad at me now?

241
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,680
Hey!
Hey!

242
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,122
I was shocked.

243
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
What's wrong with you?

244
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,720
I dreamed again.

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,120
You will see. It's going to happen today.

246
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:34,935
A bottle of water, please.

247
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,480
Um.

248
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
Ai.

249
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
You are too obsessed with this.

250
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Shh... Haven't you heard that saying?

251
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,080
If you don't believe it,

252
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,160
don't disrespect it.

253
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,680
He's definitely coming.

254
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,760
A bottle of water, please.

255
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:07,491
Hey!

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,080
(I told you.)

257
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:25,683
Hi there.

258
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:27,724
Yo.

259
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,131
Why is P' Yu here?

260
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
What? I asked him to help with the photos.

261
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,661
Why didn't you tell me?

262
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:35,806
I did.

263
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:37,717
You did not.

264
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:38,851
I did.

265
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:41,531
I think?

266
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,474
So, P' Yu is here.

267
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,400
Why are you complaining?

268
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:49,077
Because...

269
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,320
I don't know.

270
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,440
Damn it.

271
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,040
Take him out.

272
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,369
Quiet Yo, quiet.

273
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,160
It's hot in here, isn't it?

274
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Can I have one cold cup of water, please?

275
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
P' Yu, the set is ready.

276
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,160
Oh, sure.

277
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,120
Give it to me.

278
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,480
Give me it.

279
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Say it nicely.
A little.

280
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
What are you fucking doing, Ing?

281
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,640
Give me it.

282
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Give.

283
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,680
You are such a bad boy, huh?

284
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,200
Ing.

285
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,920
You need to be punished.

286
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,600
Yo.

287
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,360
Naughty boy, huh?

288
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,840
What did you do?

289
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,640
No, Yo!

290
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,680
Yo! No, no!

291
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,880
This...

292
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,920
Ah...

293
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm going to work now.

294
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,131
What's the matter?

295
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
No.

296
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,920
Umm.

297
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:08,989
Did you just run from P' Yu?

298
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,920
No.

299
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,206
And who is at the food desk now?

300
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:18,091
You.

301
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Me? Are you nuts?

302
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:21,938
I am literally here.

303
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Ah... right.

304
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,680
What's up with you?

305
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Sleep too little?

306
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
Just hurry up.

307
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,240
Um.

308
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
One, two, three.

309
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
Aw, so cute.

310
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,760
Ai!

311
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:51,427
Your turn now.

312
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,280
Ready?

313
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,320
You can relax.

314
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
One, two, three.

315
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,080
Here, Too stiff.

316
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,680
Umm, wait.

317
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
Just relax, okay?

318
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,560
How does he look?

319
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,520
Looking good.

320
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,160
Right?
Yes.

321
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,280
Again.

322
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
My friend surely is the most handsome.

323
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,800
Right?

324
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
I'll do it.

325
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
Alright.

326
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Okay.

327
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Here you go.

328
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,800
Just switch.

329
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,640
Okay.

330
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
Thank you.
Thank you.

331
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,720
Let's do it.

332
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,800
We'll go again, okay?

333
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Come on.

334
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
One, two, three.

335
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,720
Relax a bit more.

336
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160
Smile too.

337
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
One, two, three.

338
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,920
Calm down. One more time.

339
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,280
All your friends are here.

340
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,760
One more time.

341
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,480
P' Yu, stop!

342
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,760
Oh no!
Gosh!

343
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,080
What happened?

344
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,160
The statue is broken.

345
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,720
It's broken.

346
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,360
Is he okay?

347
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,740
I just can't believe it.

348
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,460
You see!

349
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,460
Told ya I did not lie.

350
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,900
And now what?

351
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,660
What do you know about your dream?

352
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
I know nothing.

353
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,020
I just know that it happened
before my birthday.

354
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,300
But...

355
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,940
I don't know why or how.

356
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,860
Nothing.

357
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,820
How is this even possible?

358
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,315
And why would I know that?

359
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,580
I've been thinking so
much that my head hurts.

360
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,780
Wait a second.

361
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,180
I'll send you something.

362
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,900
There you go.

363
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,780
I found you more information.

364
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,540
Some people shared
about this similar thing.

365
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,460
Might be helpful.

366
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
Just look into it,

367
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,660
you might find those
with similar experiences,

368
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,540
and we can go talk to them.

369
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,580
Are you sure it's a good idea?

370
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,340
What? We have come this far,
Don't you want to know?

371
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,180
Don't you want to know?

372
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,540
You have to see it through.

373
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,820
Okay, okay. I'll do it.

374
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,900
Okay, see ya.

375
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:47,060
(Lil boy: Come down.)

376
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,860
Here.

377
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,580
It still hurts right?

378
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,060
Please put it on your arm.

379
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
Oh.

380
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,700
Ow!

381
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,300
Thanks...

382
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Ai! Wait!

383
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,900
Ai.

384
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,140
Are you sure we'll find him?

385
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,580
I'm tired now and it's hot too.

386
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,860
This is Thailand. Do you expect snow?

387
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,260
We'll find him.

388
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,580
I already texted all
the people we will meet

389
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,020
and all of them already sent locations.

390
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,380
Alright, let's go.

391
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,820
I thought we would just
talk to them on the phone.

392
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,900
I didn't know it would
be this serious.

393
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
You were the one giving me the information.

394
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,420
Hey, let's go there.

395
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,340
Let's go.

396
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,323
Hello!

397
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,500
Hello.

398
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,620
Where are you, K' PP?

399
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,980
I am at the playground, the yellow slide.

400
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:30,331
He said he was at the slide.

401
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,620
The slide.

402
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,740
Okay.

403
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,420
Ahh... Are you K' PP?

404
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,980
Yes. So, you dreamed too?

405
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,500
What are in your minds?

406
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Shaman?

407
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I want to know the reason,

408
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,820
why my dreams happened in real life.

409
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:40,860
(casting spells)

410
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,700
Ow!

411
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,300
Ow!

412
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,540
You stubborn spirit!

413
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,900
Take my sacred rice!

414
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,100
(casting spells)

415
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:12,300
(casting spells)

416
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,420
All the good places, huh?

417
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
This one will be it.

418
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Please let it be true.

419
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,100
That rice is still in my hair.

420
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,580
See? Get 'em out.

421
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,340
Hey!

422
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,092
Do you think it's her?

423
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Hmm probably.

424
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,740
Let's go closer.

425
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,220
Um.

426
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,180
Excuse me,

427
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,580
Are you P' Nuch?

428
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,540
Oh, Ai, right?

429
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,660
And...?

430
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,140
Ing.

431
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,500
Ing.

432
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,940
Ai, you are here because
of the dream, right?

433
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,140
Yes.

434
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,620
I found the stories you wrote
about your dreams on Facebook.

435
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
And what else do you wanna know?

436
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,380
Ahh...

437
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:36,100
Or you dream too? And they happened?

438
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,220
Don't be so shocked.

439
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,300
You are not the first one
who came to me because of this.

440
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,020
Did it happen to others too?

441
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,100
Do you remember...

442
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,460
when was the first time it happened to you?

443
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,740
Hmm... when I was about 20.

444
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,660
Ahh... and your dreams...
Do they always come true?

445
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,460
No.

446
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,900
Some came true and some did not.

447
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,100
But, I'm not sure what it is.

448
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,780
May I ask

449
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,780
your dreams that came true,

450
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,060
what are those about?

451
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,460
Are you sure?

452
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,500
Uhh...

453
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,060
What?

454
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,940
I dreamed...

455
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,300
That was so damn tiring!

456
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,700
But, at least...

457
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,020
we know now...

458
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,420
that there are others like P' Nuch

459
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
and others.

460
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:05,692
But, the dreams might differ.

461
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,660
Do you think it's true? What she said.

462
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,740
Umm...

463
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,420
there is no reason,

464
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,100
she would lie to us.

465
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,900
Um.

466
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,060
True.

467
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,260
Um.

468
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
What's wrong?

469
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,820
Are you alright?

470
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,460
Ow!

471
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,580
Fuck!

472
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,900
What did you dream about?

473
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,980
P' Yu!

474
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,820
P' Yu!

475
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:17,644
P' Yu!

476
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Where is P' Yu?

477
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,060
P' Yu! I'm at the park.

478
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Hey!

479
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,820
What's up with you?

480
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,460
Get off!

481
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:33,940
Hey!

482
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,700
I said get off!

483
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,820
Hey! That's mine!

484
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,500
I told you to get off.

485
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Not gonna get off, huh?

486
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
It's yours, right?

487
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Wanna get it?

488
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,460
Huh?

489
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,900
No words now?

490
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,220
P' Yu.

491
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,140
You okay?

492
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,540
Let's go home.

493
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,100
Go.

494
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,500
Ow!

495
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,140
P' Yu!

496
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,860
Are you okay?

497
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,060
Are you alright?

498
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,860
I'm alright.

499
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,300
How about you?

500
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,500
Worry about yourself first.

501
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,260
Let's go home.

502
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,860
P' Yu.

503
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Don't tell my mom and dad.

504
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,580
But you got hurt.

505
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,460
I don't wanna worry them.

506
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,700
Please.

507
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,380
Thank you very much.

508
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,060
Yes, thank you.

509
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,860
Let me see the wound.

510
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,580
Does it hurt much?

511
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,740
Of course, it does.

512
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,980
Take off your shirt,
and I'll do first aid.

513
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,500
Huh.

514
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,900
Why are you so scared?

515
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,100
No...

516
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,940
I'll do it myself.

517
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,780
I'm a grown man.

518
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,740
I'm no longer a boy.

519
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,300
Or...

520
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,860
Do you think I'm going
to do something to you?

521
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,260
Who? Think what?

522
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,020
I did not.

523
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,620
If you have no weird
thoughts, then take off your shirt.

524
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,660
Okay.

525
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,700
You can go home and let
your mom see you like this.

526
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,740
Hmm... fine.

527
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
It still hurts.

528
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,060
Sorry.

529
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,180
Tell me if it hurts you.

530
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,180
You can stay here tonight.

531
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:49,980
What? Ow!

532
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,180
Why are you so shocked?

533
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,100
No way... I... will not...

534
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:55,940
P' Yu.

535
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,980
I...

536
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I... will not...

537
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,260
So shocked that you cannot form a sentence?

538
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:05,980
Hey.

539
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,380
How can you go home,

540
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,300
and let your mom see you like this?

541
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,540
Stay here.

542
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,740
Stay with me tonight.

543
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,540
Why?

544
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
We used to sleep
together when we were kids.

545
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,540
Hmm?

546
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,100
I'll just put on the shirt
and my mom won't see it.

547
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
What if she does?

548
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,660
This is kinda deep.

549
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,500
Ow!

550
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,780
Sorry, sorry.

551
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,940
Be gentle.

552
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,540
You were the naughty one.

553
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,780
Who would go out so late.

554
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,660
Is that right?

555
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,460
Ow!

556
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,820
What?

557
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,300
Did it hurt?

558
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,500
Turn around.

559
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Come on, turn around.

560
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,900
Alright.

561
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,780
Hmm...

562
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,540
so you're not looking
away from my gaze now?

563
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,660
What? Who looked away??

564
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
You, turn that way.

565
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,820
I'm going to sleep now.

566
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,740
I cannot sleep facing that way.

567
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,620
Go to sleep.

568
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,420
No more complaints, shhhh.

569
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,740
I dreamt that I had sex
with my first boyfriend.

570
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,580
But, the dreams you had, I'm jealous of it.

571
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,340
Why?

572
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,980
If I had dreamed about any accident,

573
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I would have stop it from happening.

574
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,900
Or, I would have spent more time with him.

575
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,820
Made the most out of our time.

576
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,220
Good dreams aren't always good.

577
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,300
Right?

578
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,760
(Next Episode)
You dreamed that P' Yu was drowning?

579
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,840
When and where?

580
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,400
That's the problem.

581
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,379
P' Yu.

582
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:58,012
Can I sleep with you tonight?

583
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,760
Are you okay during this time?

584
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
And if I say I'm okay.

585
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
You can see that I'm lying.

586
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,920
Why are you pleasing me so much today?

587
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,720
You're burning up. I'll wipe you down.
